<p class="no-indent p2"><span class="smcap">My Dear Norman</span>,</p>

<p>Here are my Patchwork Papers for
you to unpick at your leisure. I have
not presumed to call them essays, since
it is nowadays unseemly for a novelist
to attempt anything worthy of the name
of letters—moreover, would any one
read them? By the same token, I have
not dared to call them short stories, and
that, mainly because the so-called essential
love interest is conspicuous by its
absence. Really they are illustrated
essays. What better name then than
papers can be given them?</p>

<p>It may, for example, be pardonable in
a paper to split an infinitive for the sake
of euphony, as I have done in “From
my Portfolio,”—but to split an infinitive
in an essay! It were better to
rob a church, or speak out one’s mind
about the monarchy. All such things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
as these are treasonable. To call them
papers then will save me much from my
friends.</p>

<p>When they appeared serially, it was
under the title “Beauties which are
Inevitable.” I altered that when I
thought of you trying to remember what
the book was called, as you recommended
it with a twinkle in your eye to
your friends. But that title still stands
justified in my mind, since these papers
express the things which latterly have
become realities to me. For wheresoever
you may go in this world—whether
it be striving to the highest heights, or
descending, as some would have it, to
the deepest depths—life is just as ugly
or just as beautiful as you are inclined
to find it.</p>

<p>In all my early work, until, in fact,
I wrote “Sally Bishop,” I was inclined
to find it ugly enough in all conscience.
But now beauty does seem inevitable
and, what is more, the only reality we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
have. For if, as they say, God made
man in His own image, then to call the
ugliness of man a reality is to curse the
sight of God; in which case, it were as
well to die and have done with this business
of existence altogether.</p>

<p>To see nothing but ugliness then, or,
as the modern school would have it, to
see nothing but realism, is a form of
mental suicide which, thank God, no
longer appeals to me. For when every
year I find the daffodils bringing up
their glory of colour and beauty of line
with unfailing perfection, I cannot but
think that man, made in God’s image,
was meant to be still more beautiful in
his thoughts and deeds even than they.
Then surely what man was meant to be
must be the only true reality of what
he is. All else happens to him. That
is all.</p>

<p>Wherefore, when, in these pages, you
read of Bellwattle and of Emily the
housemaid, of my little old pensioner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
or of the poor woman in Limehouse;
when, too, you read my attempt to give
words to the maternal instinct; then you
will see realities as I have seen them
over the past two years and I dedicate
this true record of them to you, because
I know that you will take them to be as
real as the beauty of Livy, the manliness
of Nod, or the colour of those wall-flowers
which bloom by the little red-brick
paths in that graceful garden of
yours in Kent.</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">I
<br />
<small>THE PENSION OF THE PATCHWORK
QUILT</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">So much more than you would ever
dream lies hidden behind the beauty of
“The Blue Bird,” by Maurice Maeterlinck.
Beauty may be the first of its
qualities. By the same token, beauty
may be the last. But in the midst, in the
heart of it, there is set a deep well of
truth—fathomless almost—one of those
natural wells which God, with His
omnipotent disregard of limitations, has
sunk into the heart of the world.</p>

<p>That utter annihilation of death must
be confusion to many when expressed
in terms of St. Joseph lilies. Ninety per
cent. of people will be likely to say,
“How pretty!” That is the worst of it.
They ought to be feeling, “How true!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet what is a man to do? He can
only express the immortality that he
knows in terms of the material things
he sees. St. Joseph lilies are as good as,
if not better than anything else. But
they might as well have been artichokes,
which come up every year. Artichokes
would have done just as well, only that
people who object to artichokes would
have said, “How silly!”</p>

<p>No one can object to St. Joseph lilies.
Yet, whatever they are, you will never
be able to persuade the world to see the
immortal truth behind the mortal and
material fact.</p>

<p>It was the chance of circumstance
which gave me an example of that
amazing truth that old people, when
they have passed away, are given life
whenever the young people think of
them. To the hundreds and thousands
who have been to see “The Blue Bird”
there are hundreds and thousands to
say, “How charming that idea is—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
old people coming to life again whenever
any one thinks of them!”</p>

<p>“And how amazingly true,” said I to
one who had made the remark to me.</p>

<p>The lady looked at me as at one who
has made a needless jest and then she
laughed. Being a lady, she was polite.</p>

<p>But I hated that politeness. I hated
the laugh which expressed it. If chance
should make her eye to fall upon this
page, she will see how I hated it. She
will see also how earnestly I had meant
what I said. For I have found a proof
of the truth. I know now that the old
people live. What is more, they know
it too. When it comes that they pass
that Rubicon which takes them into the
shadow of those portals beneath which
all the old people must wait until the
Great Gates are opened—when once
they near the three-score years and ten—then
they know. But they may not
speak. They may not say they know.
They can only hint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>It was that an old lady hinted to me.
Oh, such a broad hint it was! And that
is how I know.</p>

<p>She was close on seventy. Another
summer, another winter, and yet another
spring, would see her three-score
years and ten. The pension of the
country would be given her then and
this great ambition had leapt into the
heart of her:</p>

<p>“I want to leave off work then, sir,”
she said and a smile parted her thin,
wrinkled lips, lit two fires in her eyes,
making her whole face sparkle. “I want
to leave off work then, sir, and I want to
take a little cottage. I only work now
so that my sons shan’t have the expense
of keeping me. They’ve got expenses
enough of their own.” Then her little
brown eyes, like beads in the deep hollows,
took into them a tender look as
she thought of the trials and troubles
which they had to bear.</p>

<p>“Will you ever be able to get a cottage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and keep yourself alive on five shillings
a week?” I asked.</p>

<p>She set her little mouth. She was a
wee, tiny creature, shrivelled with age.
Everything about her was little and
crumpled and old.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t need much to keep me
alive now, sir,” she said. “The cottage
I can get for half a crown a week; and,
of course, my sons are real good boys—they
send me a little now and then.”</p>

<p>I gazed at her—at her wee, withered
body, wasted away to nothing in tireless
energy.</p>

<p>“You know you won’t care to leave
off work when it comes to the time,”
said I; “you’ll hate to have nothing
to do.”</p>

<p>She looked back at me with a cunning
twinkle in her bright brown eyes. As
if she were fool enough to think that
life would be bearable with nothing to
do! As if she had ever dreamed that
the hands could be idle while the heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
was beating! As if she did not know
that each must labour until death stilled
them both!</p>

<p>“I shan’t have nothing to do, sir,”
she said when she had said it already
with her eyes. “Why, it’s just the time
I’ve been looking for. I’m too busy
now.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Make a patchwork quilt.”</p>

<p>“A patchwork quilt?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“So that I can leave something behind
me for people to remember me
when I’m gone.”</p>

<p>She said it quite cheerfully, quite
happily. Her bright eyes glistened like
a wink of light in an old brown china
tea-pot. She said it, too, in that half-reserved
way as though there were
more to tell, but she was not allowed
even to whisper it.</p>

<p>Of course, there was more to tell!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
She never would be gone! Not really
gone! Every time you thought of her,
the light of the other life would start
back into her eyes, the wrinkled lips
would smile again. She would never be
really gone! And this was a hint—just
a hint to let me at least, for one, make
sure about it.</p>

<p>“Then every night they go to bed,”
said I, “and pull the patchwork quilt
tight round them——”</p>

<p>“Yes—and every time they throw it
off in the morning——” said she.</p>

<p>“They’ll think of you?”</p>

<p>“They’ll think of me,” and she
chuckled like a little child to think how
clever it was of her.</p>

<p>“Supposing,” said I, suddenly, in a
whisper as the thought occurred to me—“supposing
you could do without any
assistance from your boys——”</p>

<p>“I wish I could,” she said; “p’raps I
can.”</p>

<p>“You wait and see,” said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Her seventieth birthday came round,
and the evening before I posted to her
my little present. I made her my pensioner
as long as she lives, and on the
twentieth day of each month she receives
her tiny portion, and on the
twenty-first day of that month I get
back in return a wee bunch of flowers
tied with red Angola wool.</p>

<p>“In payment of the Pension of the
Patchwork Quilt,” I write, just on a
slip of paper; then off it goes every
month. And as I drop it in the letterbox,
I can see her surrounded with all
sorts of materials in divers colours. I
can hear the scratching of her needle as
she sews them together. I can picture
her little eyes bent eagerly upon the
stitches for fear it might not be done in
time.</p>

<p>And I take her gentle hint.</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">II
<br />
<small>THE MOUSE-TRAP, HENRIETTA STREET</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">In Henrietta Street, Covent Garden,
there is a mouse-trap, a cunningly devised
contrivance in which many a timid
little mouse is caught. You will find
them in other streets than this. They
are set in exactly the same way, the
same alluring bait, the same doors that
open with so generous an admission of
innocence, the same doors that close
with so final and irrevocable a snap.</p>

<p>I have never watched the other ones
at work. But I have seen four mice
caught at different times in Henrietta
Street. Therefore, it is about the
mouse-trap in Henrietta Street that I
feel qualified to speak.</p>

<p>One of these little mice I knew well.
I knew her by name, where she lived—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
little hole in this great labyrinth of
London down which she vanished when
the day’s work was done, or when any
one frightened her little wits and made
her scamper home for safety. She even
came once and sat in my room, just on
the edge of an armchair, taking tea and
cake in that frightened way, eyes ever
peering, head ever on the alert, as mice
will eat their food.</p>

<p>So you will see I knew a good deal
about her. It was through no accident
of chance that I saw her walk into the
trap. I had heard that such an event
was likely. I was on the lookout
for it.</p>

<p>During the day-time, she waited at
the tables in an A.B.C. shop. Don’t ask
me what they paid her for it. I marvel
at the wage for manual labour when
sometimes I am compelled to do a little
job for myself. I wonder why on earth
the woman comes to tidy my rooms for
ten shillings a week. But she does.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
What is more, I find myself on the very
point of abusing her when she breaks a
piece of my Lowestoft china, coming
with tears in her eyes to tell me of it.</p>

<p>Whatever it was they paid this little
mouse of a child, she found it a sufficient
inducement to come there day after day,
week after week, with just that one
short, marvellous evening in the six
days and the whole of the glorious
seventh in which to do what she liked.</p>

<p>I suppose it would have gone on like
that for ever. She would have continued
creeping in and out amongst the
tables, her body on tip-toe, her voice on
tip-toe, the whole personality of her
almost overbalancing itself as it worked
out its justification on the very tip of its
toes.</p>

<p>She would have continued waiting on
her customers, writing her little checks
in a wholly illegible handwriting, which
only the girl at the desk could read. She
would have continued supplying me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
with the three-pennyworth of cold cod
steak for my kitten until I should have
been ordering five cold cod steaks for
the entire family that was bound to
come. All these things would have gone
on just the same, had not the tempter
come to lure her into the mouse-trap in
Henrietta Street, Covent Garden.</p>

<p>I saw him one morning, a dandy-looking
youth from one of the hosier’s
shops in the Strand near by. He was
having lunch—a cup of coffee and some
stewed figs and cream. Taste is a
funny thing. And she was serving him.
She had served him. He was already
hustling the food into his mouth as he
talked to her. But it was more than
talking. He was saying things with a
pair of large calf eyes and she was
laughing as she listened.</p>

<p>I would sooner see a woman serious
than see her laugh; that is, if some one
else were making love to her. For when
she is serious there are two ways about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
it; but when she laughs there is only
time for one.</p>

<p>When she saw me, the little mouse
came at once to the counter and took
down the piece of cold cod steak without
a word. As she handed me the bag and
the little paper check, she said—</p>

<p>“How’s the kitten to-day?”</p>

<p>Then I knew she felt guilty, and was
trying to distract my mind from what
she knew I had seen.</p>

<p>“Why are you ashamed of talking to
the young man?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I’m not,” said she.</p>

<p>“Did you notice his eyes?” said I.</p>

<p>She looked at me for a moment, quite
frightened, then she scampered away
into a corner and began wetting her
pencil with her lips and scribbling
things. When the young man tapped
his coffee-cup, she pretended not to
hear. But as soon as I stepped out into
the street, I turned round and saw her
hurrying back to his table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>You guess how it went along. He
asked her to marry him—then—there—at
once. You might have known he
was a man of business.</p>

<p>She told me all about it when she
came on one of those short evenings,
and nibbled a little piece of cake as she
sat on the edge of my chair.</p>

<p>He wanted to marry her at once, but
he was earning only eighteen shillings a
week and, as far as I could see, spent
most of that on neckties, socks and hair
oil. He would no doubt begin to save it
directly they were married; but eighteen
shillings was not enough to keep them
both.</p>

<p>“He’d better wait, then,” said I.</p>

<p>“He’s so afraid he’d lose me,” she
whispered.</p>

<p>“And would he?” I asked.</p>

<p>She picked up a crumb from the floor,
seeming thereby to suggest that it was
not in the nature of her to waste anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I suppose you’ll be married in
secret and go on just the same?”</p>

<p>She nodded her head.</p>

<p>“Where does he propose you should
be married?”</p>

<p>“At the registry office in Henrietta
Street.”</p>

<p>“The mouse-trap,” said I.</p>

<p>“No; the registry office,” she replied.</p>

<p>“And when’s it to be?” I asked.</p>

<p>“My next evening after this.”</p>

<p>Well, it came to that next evening.
I got permission from a firm of book-buyers
to occupy a window opposite.
And there I observed that little parlour
tragedy which you can see in the corner
of any old wainscotted room if only you
keep quiet long enough.</p>

<p>It did not happen successfully that
first time. For half an hour he walked
her up and down Henrietta Street. I
saw my publisher come out of his door,
little dreaming of the comedy that was
being played as he passed them by. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
every time they stopped outside the
Registry Office windows, she stood and
read the notices of soldiers deserted the
army, of children that were lost, while
he talked of the great things that life
was offering to them both just inside
those varnished doors.</p>

<p>After a time they walked away and I
came out from my hiding-place. Something
must have upset her, I thought,
and I went across to look at the notices
in the window. There was nothing to
frighten her there; yet she had scampered
away home to that little hole in
Clapham, and there vanished out of
sight.</p>

<p>But it came at last. It came the very
next of her short evenings. I was on
the lookout again. I saw them march
up to the door. No hesitation this time.
He must have been eloquent indeed to
have led her so surely as that.</p>

<p>I saw him lift the spring of the trap.
I saw her enter with tip-toe steps, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
more full of confidence now. Then I
heard the sharp snap of the door as it
fell.</p>

<p>“They’ve caught a mouse,” said I to
the book-buyer as I came downstairs.</p>

<p>“’Tis a good thing,” said he; “they’re
the very devil for eating my bindings.”</p>

<br />
<small>THE WONDERFUL CITY</small></h2>

</div>




<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">III
<br />
<small>THE WONDERFUL CITY</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">I saw a wonderful city to-day. Rows
of houses there were. Domes of great
buildings with their dull brown roofs
lifted silently into the sky. Long streets
in tireless avenues led from one cathedral
to another; some with the straightness
of an arrow, others twisting and
turning in devious ways, yet all leading,
as a well-planned street should lead, to
the crowning glory of some great
edifice.</p>

<p>By the chance of Destiny I stood
above it all and looked down. It was
strange that only the night before I had
been dreaming that I was in the City of
New York, with its vast maze of buildings
leaping to the sky. In my dream I
had stood wrapt in amazement. But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was silent with a greater astonishment
here. For as I gazed upon it, there had
come a man to my side and, seeing the
direction of my eyes, he had said—</p>

<p>“There warn’t a trace o’ that there
last night.”</p>

<p>“Not a trace?” said I. And I said it
in amazement, for frankly I disbelieved
him.</p>

<p>“Not a trace,” he repeated solemnly.</p>

<p>“All that built in one night?” I asked
again.</p>

<p>“In one night,” said he.</p>

<p>“But doesn’t it astound you?” said I.
I tried to lift his lethargy to the wonderment
and admiration that was thrilling
in my mind.</p>

<p>“It do seem strange,” he replied,
“when yer come to think of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, come to think of it!” I
exclaimed. “You can’t do better than
find the world strange. Come to think
of it and, finding it strange, you’ll come
to believe in it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>He stared at me with solemn eyes.</p>

<p>“Look at the dome of that cathedral,”
I went on. “Could you set to work and,
in a single night, build a vast piece of
architecture like that, so many times
higher than yourself?”</p>

<p>“That ain’t no cathedral,” said he.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen a cathedral?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, how do you know it
isn’t?”</p>

<p>He could give me no reply and I continued
in my enthusiasm—</p>

<p>“Look at that street, cut through all
obstacles, leading straight as though a
thousand instruments of latter-day
science had been used in the making of
it. Look at this avenue turning to right
and to left. Do you see that great cluster
of buildings, a very parliament of
houses, set round a vast space that
would shame the great square of St.
Peter’s, in Rome. Only look at the——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>I turned round and he had gone. I
could see his figure retreating in the distance.
Every moment he turned his
head, looking round, as one who is pursued
yet fears to show his cowardice by
running away. He thought I was mad,
I have no doubt. Every one thinks you
mad when you say the moon is a dead
world or the sun is a fiery furnace. To
be sane, you must only remark upon the
coldness of the moon, or the warmth of
the sun. To be sane, you must speak of
the things of this world only in terms
of people’s bodies. They do not understand
unless.</p>

<p>And so, when the man left me, I was
alone, looking over the wonderful city.
For an hour then, I amused myself by
naming the different streets, by assigning
to the various buildings the uses
to which it seemed they might be
put.</p>

<p>That huge edifice with the cupola of
bronze was the Cathedral of Shadows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
where prayers were said in darkness
and never a lamp was lit. The street
which led to its very steps, that was
called the Street of Sighs. Here, in a
lighter part of the city, approached to
its silent doors by Tight Street, was the
Bat’s Theatre, where you could hear,
but never see the performance as it
progressed. A little further on there
was Blind Alley—a cul-de-sac, terminating
in a tiny building, the Chapel of
Disappointment. There was the Avenue
of Progress, the Church of Whispers,
the Bridge of Stones and a thousand
other places, the names of which
went from me no sooner than they
crossed my mind.</p>

<p>It may be possible to build a wonderful
city in a night. I only know how
utterly impossible it is to name all its
streets and its palaces in one day.</p>

<p>And then, while I was still thus employed,
I saw the man returning with a
jug of beer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>I nodded to the vessel which he carried
in his hand.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to think about that,”
said I, “to understand it.”</p>

<p>A broad grin spread across his face.
He had found me sane after all. I had
talked about beer in terms of bodily
comfort.</p>

<p>“I need to drink it,” said he with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“You do,” said I.</p>

<p>Then, as if to appease me for the
moment e’er he passed on his way, he
returned to our former subject and,
with a serious voice, he said—</p>

<p>“When yer come to think of it,” said
he, “it do seem wonderful that them
moles is blind.”</p>

<p>“Not so blind,” said I, looking down
at the wonderful city, “not so blind as
those who can see.”</p>

<p>He thought I had gone mad again,
and he walked away with his jug of
beer.</p>

<h2>IV
<br />
<small>BELLWATTLE AND THE LAWS
OF GOD</small></h2>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>




<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">IV
<br />
<small>BELLWATTLE AND THE LAWS OF GOD</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">I often wonder why God evolved a
creature so antagonistic to all His laws
as woman. I must tell you what I
mean.</p>

<p>Bellwattle—she is named Bellwattle
for the simple reason that one day in an
inspired moment, she called her husband
Cruikshank, and he replied giving her
the name Bellwattle, quite foolish except
between husband and wife—Bellwattle
has the genuine mother’s heart
for animals. Everything that crawls,
walks or flies, Bellwattle loves. Some
things, certainly, she loves more than
others; but for all she has the deep-rooted,
protective instinct. Spiders, for
example, terrify her; flies and beetles
she loathes, but would not kill one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
them even if they crawled upon her
dress. And they do.</p>

<p>Now Bellwattle has a garden which
she loves. You can see already, if you
have but the mind for it, the tragic conflict
which, with that love of her flowers,
she must wage between her own soul
and the laws of God.</p>

<p>For this, I must tell you, is a lovely
garden—not one of those prim-set portions,
with well-cut hedges and beds in
orthodox array. It is an old garden
that has been allowed to run to ruin and
Bellwattle, possessing it in the nick of
time, has planted primroses amongst the
nettles; has carved a little herbaceous
border where once potatoes grew. She
has thrown roses here, there, and everywhere
and, in soap and sugar boxes covered
with glass at the bottom of the garden
under the nut trees, she forces the
old-fashioned flowers that we knew—you
and I—in the long-ago days when
sweet-william and candytuft were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
things to boast about and foxgloves
grew like beanstalks up to heaven.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most glorious thing
in Bellwattle’s garden, that also in
which she takes the greatest pride, is
her hedges of sweet pea. They grow
in great walls of dazzling colour, and
the bees hum about them all day long.
But they are the devil and all to
raise.</p>

<p>Now this is where the tragic conflict
comes in, between the mice and the birds
and the slugs and Bellwattle’s kitten
and Bellwattle’s heart. It is a terrible
conflict, I can tell you; for the laws of
God are unalterable, and so is the heart
of Bellwattle.</p>

<p>This, then, is what happens: Bellwattle
forgot to cover the sweet pea
seeds with red lead. It is just the sort
of thing a woman would forget. I
doubt if I could think of it myself.
Then followed the natural result. A
shrew-mouse got hold of one or two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
them, and Bellwattle wondered why on
earth God ever made shrew-mice.</p>

<p>“But they’re dear little things,” I told
her.</p>

<p>“I can’t help that,” said she. “What’s
the sense in making a thing that goes
and eats up other things?”</p>

<p>Which, of course, was unanswerable.</p>

<p>Two days after this had happened,
the kitten was seen playing with a live
shrew-mouse.</p>

<p>Bellwattle screamed.</p>

<p>“Oh, the little wretch! If I could
only catch it!”</p>

<p>“What—the mouse?” shouted Cruikshank.</p>

<p>“No, no; the wretched little kitten!
Look at the way she’s torturing it! Oh,
I never saw such a cruel little beast in
all my life!” and her face grew rosy red.</p>

<p>Now, Cruikshank is a dutiful husband.
Moreover, he knows positively
nothing about women. Perhaps that is
why. When, therefore, he realised that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
it was the kitten who was the cruel little
beast, and a sense of duty claiming him,
he chased it all over the garden, picking
up stones as he ran.</p>

<p>“Make her drop it!” cried Bellwattle.</p>

<p>“I will, if I can hit her,” replied
Cruikshank and, like a cowboy throwing
a lasso from a galloping horse, he
flung a stone. The kitten was struck
upon the flank and in its terror it
dropped the mouse and fled. Cruikshank
approached it and, he assures me,
with much pride in his prowess picked
up the poor little mouse by the hind leg.
Then he looked up and saw Bellwattle’s
face. It was white—ashen white.</p>

<p>“You’ve hurt her,” she said, half
under her breath.</p>

<p>“It’s better than hurt,” said Cruikshank—“it’s
dead.”</p>

<p>“No—the kitten—you hit it with a
stone.”</p>

<p>“’Twas a jolly good shot,” said
Cruikshank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“I never meant you to hit her,” said
Bellwattle.</p>

<p>Cruikshank looked disappointed. To
hit a flying object whilst one is in a tornado
of motion one’s self is no mean
feat. Failing an appreciation of the
woman herself, I am not surprised he
was disappointed.</p>

<p>“I made her drop it, anyhow,” he said.</p>

<p>“You’ve frightened her out of her life
and now perhaps she’ll never come
back,” said Bellwattle, and in and out of
the garden she went, all through the
forests of rhododendra—where the kitten,
I should tell you, hunts for big
game—and with the gentlest, the softest,
the most wooing voice in the world,
she cried the kitten’s name. Cruikshank
was at a loss to understand it. When
he met her down one of the paths still
calling, with tears in her eyes, he assures
me he felt so ashamed of himself that
he began, in a feeble way, calling for the
kitten too. When they met again, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
unsuccessful in their search, he dared
not look her in the face.</p>

<p>Now this is only one of the conflicts
that take place in Bellwattle’s soul.
She worships the birds, but they eat the
young shoots of the sweet peas. Then
she hates them; then the kitten catches
one. And now, Cruikshank tells me, he
will have no hand in the matter.</p>

<p>“You leave it to God,” I advised.</p>

<p>“I do,” said he; “it’s too difficult for
me.”</p>

<p>I believe myself it is too difficult for
God.</p>

<p>Only the other day, in the farmyard,
Bellwattle saw two cocks fighting—fighting
for the supremacy of the yard.
Cruikshank and I looked on, really enjoying
the sport of it in our hearts, yet
deadly afraid of saying so.</p>

<p>“Can’t you stop them?” exclaimed
Bellwattle. “They’re hurting each
other!”</p>

<p>We neither of us moved a hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you don’t, I shall have to go and
do it myself,” said she.</p>

<p>“Much better leave it to God,” said I.
“They’re settling matters that have
nothing to do with you.”</p>

<p>But do you think logic so profound as
that deterred her? Not a bit of it!
Out she ran into the farmyard, throwing
her arms about in the air—as
women will when they wish to interfere
with the laws of God.</p>

<p>“Shoo! shoo! shoo!” shouted Bellwattle.</p>

<p>And one of the cocks, at the critical
moment of victory, reluctantly leaving
go of its opponent’s comb, looked up
with considerable annoyance into her
face and shrieked back—</p>

<p>“Cock-a-doodle-do!”</p>

<p>Cruikshank glanced at me out of the
corner of his eye, and out of the corner
of his mouth he whispered—</p>

<p>“We shan’t have any eggs to-morrow.”</p>

<h2>V
<br />
<small>REALISM</small></h2>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>




<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>


<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">V
<br />
<small>REALISM</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">This word—realism—has lost its meaning.
So, for that matter, has many another
word in the language. Sentiment
is one and, as a natural consequence, the
word sentimental is another. Realism
and sentiment, in fact, have got so
shuffled about, for all the world like the
King and Queen in a pack of cards that
now, instead of sentiment being hand in
hand with reality, they have become
almost opposed. To express a sentiment
is now tantamount to ignoring a
reality.</p>

<p>Joseph Surface may be responsible
for this. It would not seem unlikely.
But wherever the responsibility lies, it
is an everlasting pity; no one has had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the common politeness to replace or even
create a substitute for the thing which
they have taken away.</p>

<p>Realism, which now means an expression
of things as they happen without
any relation to things as they immortally
are, is robbed of its true significance.
But no word is left in its place.
Sentiment, which now means an expression
of momentary emotionalism,
instead of what one perceives to be
true in the highest moments of one’s
thoughts, has left a blank in the language
which no one seems willing to
or capable of filling up.</p>

<p>Now all this is an irreparable loss.
How great a loss it is can be seen by
the fact that no two people’s terminology
is the same when they are discussing
a subject wherein these words
must be employed. In the space of five
minutes both are at cross purposes; in a
tangle from which they find it well-nigh
impossible to extricate themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not for one instant propose to
supply here a solution to the difficulty;
nor can I coin two words to repair the
loss sustained. All I wish to do is to
tell a real story, one that happened only
a short while ago, to illustrate what
seems to me to be realism in comparison
with what realism is supposed to be.</p>

<p>Our little servant-girl was married—married
to the young man who brought
the milk of a morning. The courtship
had been going on for some time
before I realised the glorious things that
were happening. Then, when I was
told about it, I used to peep out of my
bedroom window. As soon as I heard
that cry of his—impossible to write—when
he opened the gate and rattled
with his can down the area steps, then
up I jumped from my bed and lifted the
window.</p>

<p>They must have been wonderful
moments for Emily, those early mornings
when, with heart beating at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sound of his cry, she had run for the
big white jug, then dragged out the time
lest he should think she had opened the
door too eagerly.</p>

<p>Many a time have I seen them down
at the bottom of those area steps; she
leaning up against the pillar of the door
watching him, rapt in admiration, while
he filled up the big white jug.</p>

<p>It is a fine thing for you when your
little maid has eyes for the milkman.
You get a good measure, I can tell you.
He would not seem stingy to her for
the world. I have seen him dipping his
little half-pint measure times and again
into the big can as he talked to her and,
as she held out the white jug, just trickling
it in till our two pints were more
than accounted for.</p>

<p>All this went on for weeks together.
Emily sang like a lark in the morning
when she rose betimes to do her work.
The worst of the scrubbing was all finished
with and Emily’s hair was tidy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
long before there came that weird falsetto
cry, or the sound of the milk cans
rattled down the area steps. Oh, I can
assure you, it is an excellent thing when
your little maid has eyes for the milkman.
She never gets up late of a
morning.</p>

<p>And then, at last, with great to-doings
in Emily’s home out at Walham
Green, they were married. I asked
Emily what she would like for a wedding
present and she said:</p>

<p>“I’d like one o’ them old brass candlesticks—same
as what you ’ave in your
study.”</p>

<p>You see Emily had acquired some
taste. I call it taste because it is
mine. Good or bad, she had acquired
it.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you prefer silver?” I
asked, thinking I knew what silver
would mean in Walham Green.</p>

<p>But she only replied:</p>

<p>“No—I like the brass ones—’cos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
they’re old. I’ve a fancy for old
things.”</p>

<p>So a pair of old brass candlesticks
was what I gave her. She wrote and
thanked me for them. She said they
looked just lovely on George’s writing
table and that one of these days, when
I was passing that way, I ought to go
and look at them.</p>

<p>I did pass through Walham Green
eventually. It was some months later.
She had probably forgotten all about
having asked me, but I paid my visit all
the same.</p>

<p>For a moment or so, as I stood on the
doorstep, I felt a twinge of trepidation.
I could not remember her married
name. But it was all right. She
opened the door herself. Then, as she
stood there, with a beaming smile lighting
her face from ear to ear, reminding
me so well of those early mornings
when I used to peep out of my bedroom
window and peer into the area below, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
saw that soon there would be another
little Emily or another perky little
George to bring a smile or a cry into the
world.</p>

<p>“You’re happy?” said I.</p>

<p>“Oh—sir!” said she.</p>

<p>She showed me up then to the sitting-room
where was George’s writing table
and the pair of old brass candlesticks.
She pointed to the table.</p>

<p>“’E made it ’imself,” she said, not
meaning it in explanation; but it did explain
the queer shape. “’E made it out
of an old box and I covered it with felt.
Ain’t it splendid?”</p>

<p>I agreed with my whole heart. Everything
was splendid. The whole room
might have been made out of an old box.
And yet I could see what a joy it was
to her. There was her acquired taste
in evidence everywhere, but except for
my poor pair of candlesticks, everything
was imitation. It made no matter. She
thought they were really old and liked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
them immeasurably better than the
things I had collected with such care at
home.</p>

<p>“Could anything be nicer than this?”
said I with real enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it could, sir,” said she.</p>

<p>And then, in little half-amused, half-curious,
half-frightened whispers, she
told me how they were going to call the
baby after me.</p>

<p>“Supposing it’s a girl,” said I.</p>

<p>No—they had not reckoned on that.
When you make up your mind properly
to a boy—a boy it is up to the last moment.
After that, you forget how you
made up your mind, you are so wildly
delighted that it is alive at all.</p>

<p>I walked across to the window.</p>

<p>“So you’re radiantly happy,” I said.</p>

<p>“’E’s just wonderful,” she replied;
“I thought it couldn’t last at first—but
it’s just the same.”</p>

<p>I gazed out of the window—envious,
perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“What does this look on to?” I asked.</p>

<p>“A slaughter-house, sir.”</p>

<p>She said it full of cheerfulness, full
of the joy of her own life. I stared
and stared out of the window. A
slaughter-house! A slaughter-house!
and here was a little slip of a
woman passing through those trembling
hours before the birth of her first
child!</p>

<p>Now <em>that</em> is what your realist would
call a chance! He would make a fine
subject out of that. He would show
you the growth of that idea in the
woman’s mind. He would picture her
drawn to gaze out of that awesome window
whenever they dragged the lowing,
frightened cattle to their doom. And
last of all, with wonderful photographic
touches, he would describe for you the
birth of a <em>still-born</em> child. Then with a
feeling of sickness in the heart of you,
you would lay down the story and exclaim,
“How real!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>That is what is meant by realism
to-day.</p>

<p>Yet somehow or other I prefer my
Emily; not because the boy <em>is</em> called
after me—but because, whatever he
may be called, he is alive, he is well, and
he kicks his little legs like wind-mills.</p>

<p>Now <em>that</em> is an immortal truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>


<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">VI
<br />
<small>THE SABBATH</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">When I was a little boy—younger even
than I am now—my father had strict
ideas upon Sabbath behaviour. We
might read nothing, I remember, but
what was true. Now, if you come to
think of it, that limits your range of
literary entertainment in a terrible way.
It drove me to such books as “Little
Willie’s Promise—a True Story” or
“What Alice Found—Taken from
Life.”</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon, perched high
in the mulberry-tree, I was found with
a copy of the Saturday’s daily paper. It
was smeared with the bloodstains of
many mulberries, whose glorious last
moments had been with me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“What have you got there?” asked
my father from below.</p>

<p>I told him. It was Sunday. My story
at least was true.</p>

<p>“Come down at once!” said he.</p>

<p>I descended, finding many more difficulties
to overcome than I had discovered
in my ascent.</p>

<p>My father waxed impatient.</p>

<p>“Can’t you get down any quicker than
that?” he asked. He had a book on
rose-growing in his hand, which, being
quite true, he was taking out on that
glorious afternoon to read and enjoy in
the garden.</p>

<p>With all respect, I told him that
I did not want to break my neck
and I continued slowly with my
laborious descent. When I reached
the ground, he eyed me suspiciously.</p>

<p>“How dare you read the paper on
Sunday?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I was only reading the police reports,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
said I, humbly; “I thought they
were true.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand expressively. I
timidly put forth mine, thinking he
wanted to congratulate me on my taste.</p>

<p>“The paper!” said he, emphatically.</p>

<p>I yielded, without a word.</p>

<p>“Now, if you want to read on Sunday,”
said he, “go into the house and
learn the Collect for the third Sunday
after Trinity. And never let me see a
boy of your age reading the paper
again.”</p>

<p>“Not on week-days?” said I.</p>

<p>“No, never!” he replied, and, as he
walked away, he scanned the Stock Exchange
quotations with a stern and unrelenting
face.</p>

<p>I do not want to argue about the
justice of this, for now that I am a
little older, the after effect, though not
what my father expected, has proved
quite admirable. If the newspaper was
not true enough to read on week-days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
let alone Sundays, I came to the conclusion
that it must be very full of lies
indeed. And all this has been very helpful
to me ever since. I think of it now
as I open my daily paper in the morning,
and I thank my father for it from the
bottom of my heart. It has saved me
a deal of unnecessary credulity.</p>

<p>I remember, too, that all games—all
games but chess—were strictly forbidden.
That also has left an impression
on my mind—an ineffaceable impression
about the game of chess. It seems
a very stern game to me—a game rigid
in its expression of the truth. The
King and Queen are always real people,
moving—far be it from me to allude to
Royalty—in straightened paths; the
Queen impulsively, the King in staid
dignity, one step at a time. I always
behold the Knight as one, erratic and
Quixotic in all he does; the Bishop swift
and to the point, thereby connecting
himself in my mind with the days when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the Bishops went out to war and
brought the Grace of God with them on
to the battlefield, rather than with the
Bishops of to-day, who keep the Grace
of God at home.</p>

<p>So I think of the game of Chess—the
only game we were ever allowed to play
on Sunday—the game my father loved
so well above all others.</p>

<p>I don’t know what it is about the observance
of the Sabbath, but to me it
seems a beautiful idea, like a beautiful
bell; yet a bell that has been cracked
and rings with a strange, false, unmeaning
note. No one seems to be able
to get the true tone of it. Heaven
knows they ring it enough. The Church
and such followers of the Church as my
father are always pealing its message
for the world to hear; yet I
wonder how many people detect in it
the sound of that discordant note of
hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there is something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
grand in that conception of One creating
a vast universe in six days or six
ages—whichever you will—and resting
at His ease upon the seventh. Nor is it
less grand to work throughout a common
week, making a home, and on the
Sabbath to cease from labour. The
whole world is agreed that that day of
rest is needed; but are they to lay down
a law that what is rest for one man is
rest for another?</p>

<p>If that is the only way they can think
of doing it; if that is the only interpretation
of the word—rest—which they
can find, then, so far as the Sabbath is
concerned, we shall be a nation of hypocrites
or lawbreakers for the rest of our
days. And of the two, may I be one
who breaks the law. For, do what you
will with it, human nature has reached
that development when it insists upon
thinking for itself and, one man, thinking
it all out most carefully, will declare
that a game of chess is not an abomination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of the Sabbath, while another will
read the police reports in the daily
papers because they are true.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago, Charles Kingsley,
that strenuous apostle of health, urged
that it was better to play cricket on the
Green at Eversley than stay at home
and be a hypocrite—or a gambler, which
is much the same thing. But his was
only one honest voice amongst the thousands
of others who have preached a
very different gospel to that.</p>

<p>Only a short while ago, at a little
tennis club in the suburbs of London,
there came up before the committee the
question as to whether play should not
be allowed on Sunday. The club was
composed of city clerks, of members of
the Stock Exchange, of men labouring
the daily round to keep together those
homes of which both the Church and the
nation are so justly proud.</p>

<p>Every one seemed in favour of it,
until the Vicar of the parish rose and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
said that seeing there was a high fence
all round the ground, and that the players
would be hidden from the sight of
the public at large, he saw no reason
why play should not be allowed out of
Church hours—that was to say, from
two till six.</p>

<p>“But,” said he, “I must most vehemently
protest against any playing of
the game of croquet.”</p>

<p>A member of the committee, one with
a lame leg, who was debarred from tennis,
but was known to make his ten hoop
break at croquet, asked immediately for
the reason of this protest.</p>

<p>“I work all the week in the city,” said
he; “I have no other chance for playing
except late on Saturday and on Sunday.
Why should you prevent croquet?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said the Vicar, “the sound
of the croquet balls would reach the ears
of people passing by. And what do you
imagine they’d think if they heard
people playing croquet? I make no objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to tennis because, if played in a
gentlemanly way, no one outside need
know that a game was going on—but
croquet! You must remember we have
to consider others as well as ourselves.”</p>

<p>“You think it would make them feel
envious?” asked the lame man.</p>

<p>“I mean nothing of the kind,” said the
Vicar.</p>

<p>“Then what do you imagine they
would think?”</p>

<p>“They would realise that the Sabbath—the
day of rest—was being
broken.”</p>

<p>“Then we have your consent to break
it with tennis,” said the Chairman.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said the Vicar,
“that this discussion is being carried
into the region of absurdity.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree with the Vicar,” said
the lame man.</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">VII
<br />
<small>HOUSE TO LET</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">If I only knew more about women than
I do—if I only knew anything about
them at all—I might be able to understand
the vagarious indetermination of
the lady who is contemplating the occupation
of a little house quite close to me
here in the country.</p>

<p>But I know nothing about the sex—well,
next to nothing. That is as near
to the truth as a man will get on this
subject. His next to nothing, in fact, is
next to the truth. And so, with this
open confession of ignorance, I can explain
nothing about this lady. I can
only tell you all the funny things she
does.</p>

<p>There is this house to let. Well, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
less than a house. An agent, flourishing
his pen over the book of orders to
view, would call it a maisonette—what
is more, he would be right. It is a little
house—a little, tiny house. The view
from the balcony round the top of it is
beautiful; but from inside, I doubt if
you can see anything at all. I have
never been inside, but that is what I
imagine.</p>

<p>Now, the strange thing about this
lady’s attraction for it is that she has
occupied it once before. There her children
were brought up. From there they
were sent out into the world upon that
hazardous journey of fortune: that
same journey in quest of the golden
apple for which the three sons have
always set forth, ever since the first
fairy tale was written. And so the little
house is filled with recollections for her.</p>

<p>She remembers—I have heard her
speak of it—the day when Dicky, the
youngest boy, fell out from one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
windows. Not a long fall, but it was
the devil and all to carry him back into
the house. She did not say it was the
devil and all. I say it for her, because
I know when she was telling it, that was
the way she wanted to put it. But a
woman can look a little phrase like that,
which is so much better than saying it.</p>

<p>She remembers also the day when
they had nothing in the house to eat
and she, saying such things to her husband
as God has given him memory for
the rest of his life, had to go out and
scrape together whatever she could find.
It was a cold day. There was snow on
the ground. Snow in the beginning of
May! Heaven only knows how she
managed. But she succeeded.</p>

<p>There is that about women. They
will get food for their children, even
when famine is in the land, or they will
die. I know that much about them.
They have died in Ireland.</p>

<p>Well, all these things she remembers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
things which, softened by time, are no
doubt pleasant memories ere this. And
yet she cannot make up her mind.
Where she has been since they went
away, I do not know. Travelling, I imagine.
But here she is back once more,
doubtless worrying the life out of the
house agent, who is continually being
jostled in the balance of thinking he has,
then thinking he has not, let a very
doubtful property.</p>

<p>Every morning she comes and looks
over the old place. I suppose she is
staying in the neighbourhood. From
every side she views it and all the while
she talks to herself. Now, women do
this more than you would think. They
do it when they are going to bed at
night. They do it when they are getting
up in the morning. It always seems as
if there were some one inside them to
whom they must tell the truth, because,
I believe, they are the most truthful
beings in the world—to themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Only yesterday, when she thought she
was absolutely alone, I heard her saying—</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t like it, you know, once
you were fixed up there again. It’s out
of the way, of course, quiet, but you
wouldn’t like it.”</p>

<p>And then, having told herself the
truth, she began immediately to contradict
it.</p>

<p>Why they do this is more than I can
tell you. The only people who can tell
the truth, they seemingly dislike it more
than any one else. A man loves the
truth, lives for it, dies for it, but seldom
tells it. With a woman it is just the
opposite, and I cannot for the life of me
tell you why.</p>

<p>“You’d be a fool if you took it,” she
said to herself as she went away to the
house agent’s. “You don’t know who
you’ll have for neighbours. They might
be disgusting people.”</p>

<p>I followed her to the house agent’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and this, if you please, was the first
question she put to him—</p>

<p>“What sort of people do you think’ll
take the house over the way?”</p>

<p>I pitied the house agent from the bottom
of my heart, because how on earth
could he know? Yet upon his answer
hung all his chances of letting. I
thought he replied very cleverly.</p>

<p>“They’re sure to be good people,” said
he; “we only get the best class round
here.”</p>

<p>And then, just listen to her retort—</p>

<p>“But you can’t tell,” said she.
“What’s the good of pretending you
know. It might be a butcher and his
family. You couldn’t stop them if they
wanted the house.”</p>

<p>The agent leaned back in his chair,
then leaned forward over his desk, turning
over pages and pages of a ledger.</p>

<p>“Well, will you take an order to view
this one?” said he. “Same rent—a little
more accommodation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I don’t want to see any more,”
she replied. “This is the one I like
best.”</p>

<p>“Well, would you like to settle on
that?” said the agent. “I’ll write to the
landlord to-night.”</p>

<p>“I’ll let you know to-morrow,” said
she.</p>

<p>For three weeks she has gone on just
like this.</p>

<p>And it is still to let, that little house
in the bowl of my old apple tree. But
every morning she comes just the same
and, sitting on the topmost branch, she
chatters to herself incessantly for half
an hour, as starlings and women do—for
she is a lady starling. I shall be
curious to know when she makes up her
mind, but, knowing nothing about
women and less than nothing about
starlings, I cannot say when or what it
will be.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">VIII
<br />
<small>A SUFFRAGETTE</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">She thanked God, she told me, that she
had never been married.</p>

<p>She was quite old—well, quite old?
Can you ever say that of a woman?
Women are quite old for five years, but
that is all. They are quite old between
the ages of thirty-five and forty. Then,
if God has given them a heart and they
have taken advantage of the gift, youth
comes back again. It is not the youth
under the eyes, perhaps; it is the youth
in the eyes. It is not the youth around
the lips; it is the youth of the words that
issue from them.</p>

<p>Between thirty-five and forty a
woman is trying to remember her youth
and forget her age. That makes her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
quite old—quite, quite old. After that—well,
I have said, it rests with God
and her.</p>

<p>So Miss Taviner was not quite old.
She was quite young. She was sixty-three.
Her eyes twinkled, even when
she thanked God for her spinsterdom.</p>

<p>“You’ve got,” said I, “a poor opinion
of men.”</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t my opinion—’tis my
mother’s,” said she.</p>

<p>I felt there was nothing to be said to
that. It would have been unseemly on
my part—who have only just found my
own youth—to disagree with an opinion
of such long standing.</p>

<p>You must understand that Miss Taviner
could never have been beautiful.
God may have meant her to be; I don’t
know anything about that. I am only
aware how Nature interfered. For
when she was young—a child not more,
I think, than six—she was struck by
lightning, paralysed for a time, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
when she recovered, her eyes were at
loggerheads. They looked every way
but one.</p>

<p>But I like her little shrivelled face,
nevertheless. It is crafty, perhaps. She
looks as if she counts every apple on
the trees in her old garden. Why
shouldn’t she? She has a poor opinion
of men. Besides, the apples at Beech
House Farm—where her father lived
and his father before him—those apples
are part of the slender income by which
she manages to cling to the old home.
Who could blame her for counting
them? I don’t even blame her for having
the cunning look of it in her eyes.</p>

<p>No—I suppose, though I do like her
face, it is because I haven’t got to love
it. Possibly that is why she has so
poor an opinion of men. Some man
found that he could not love her face
and broke his faith with her. At least,
I thought that then. Some heartless
wretch has jilted her, I thought—taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
her to love, and then caught sight of a
prettier pair of eyes. I must admit he
need not have been on the lookout for
them.</p>

<p>“But,” said I presently, when these
ideas had passed away, “don’t you admit
men have their uses?”</p>

<p>“None!” she said emphatically.</p>

<p>“Then why,” I asked, “do you hang
up that old top hat of your father’s on
a peg in the kitchen, so that the first
tramp, as you open the door to him,
may see it?”</p>

<p>“So that he’ll think I’ve got a man in
the house, I suppose,” she replied.</p>

<p>“That’s why you have a couple of
glasses and a whiskey bottle on the table
in the evening?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then a man is useful,” said I, “as
far as his hat is concerned?”</p>

<p>She winked her crooked eyes at me
and she said, “Yes, so long as there
isn’t a head inside of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>I laughed. “Then really,” I concluded,
“you do hate men?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I do,” said she.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>I thought I was going to hear of her
little romance with its pitiable ending.</p>

<p>But no, she merely shrugged her
shoulders, stuck an old tam-o’-shanter
on her head, and went out to see if the
gardener was doing his fair share of
work.</p>

<p>I might never have thought of this
again, but it chanced that I bought from
her, amongst her old relics of the family
property, a mahogany box, with
brass lock and brass handle. Inlaid, it
was, round the edge of the lid. Quite
a handsome thing. She had lost its key.
It was locked and, seeing that she did
not want to go to the expense of getting
a key made, she sold it to me.</p>

<p>I got a key made. I opened it. It
was empty, but for one thing. There
was a letter at the bottom. It is unquestionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that I had no right to read
it. It is also unquestionable that I did.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

forge?—Yrs. in haste, Henry Yeoman.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>“That’s the man,” said I to myself.
“He was ashamed of being seen with
her even then. No wonder she has a
poor opinion of men.” My anger went
out to Henry Yeoman on the spot.</p>

<p>But I did him an injustice. For, inquiring
at the forge, which I happened
to pass some days later, I stopped and
asked the smith about him.</p>

<p>“Henry Yeoman,” said he, “why he’s
left these parts nigh fifteen years. He’s
gone to live at Reading.”</p>

<p>“Is he married?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; married Miss Taviner.”</p>

<p>“Miss Taviner?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; sister of her down at Beech
House Farm.”</p>

<p>“Never knew she had a sister,” said I.</p>

<p>“Yes. Oh, she had three; all married,
they are.”</p>

<p>“Why did she never marry?” I asked,
for then I knew the letter was not to
her.</p>

<p>“Why?” He tapped the anvil with
his hammer and he laughed a bass accompaniment
to its ring. “Because no
one ’ud ever look at her, I suppose.”</p>

<p>I saw it then. I saw why she had so
poor opinion of men. I saw why she
thanked God she had never married.</p>

<p>No man had ever taught her what
love was. No man had ever even jilted
her. No wonder she hated them. No
wonder she counted her apples.</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">IX
<br />
<small>BELLWATTLE AND THE LAWS OF NATURE</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">It is not mine to distinguish between
the laws of God and the laws of Nature.
This is a distinction peculiar to Bellwattle.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to give precise
definition to her conception of the subtle
and imaginary line which divides the
two, but, so far as I can grasp it, it
would seem to be this: The laws of God
determine those things which happen
despite themselves and to the confusion
of all Bellwattle’s pre-conceived opinions.
When, for example, a caterpillar,
in its hazardous struggle for existence,
eats into the heart of her favourite rosebud,
that is, for Bellwattle, one of the
laws of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, the laws of Nature are quite
different to this. The laws of Nature—so
Bellwattle, I fancy, would tell
you—command those things which
happen of their own accord and to the
satisfaction of all Bellwattle’s pre-conceived
anticipations. When, for example,
a rose tree bears a thousand blossoms
from May to the end of December;
when the peas are ready to pick in
the first week in June, and the delphiniums
have grown yet another inch when,
every morning, she steps out into the
garden to look at them—these are, for
Bellwattle, the orderly workings of the
laws of Nature.</p>

<p>I see her point. I sympathise with
her distinction and I wish—oh, <em>how</em>
I wish!—that I could think as she
does. For it is a fixed idea with her.
Nothing will shake it. And I have
never met any one whose appreciation
of Nature is as great as hers.</p>

<p>Only the other day—so Cruikshank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
her husband, tells me—they came across
a wild flower in one of the hedges. In
blossom and general appearance it bore
so close a relation to Shepherd’s Needle
that at first sight of it, he dubbed it
straight away. On closer examination
it was found that there were no needles;
neither could it be Shepherd’s Purse,
for there were no purses.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s a Shepherd’s Needle
gone wrong?” suggested Bellwattle, and
Cruikshank tells me he left it at that.
The sublime conception of it was beyond
the highest reaches of his imagination.</p>

<p>On another occasion, when I had the
honour to accompany her on her walk,
we heard the raucous note of a bird
from somewhere away in the meadows.</p>

<p>“I bet you don’t know what that is!”
said I, to test her knowledge; but she
answered quite easily—</p>

<p>“It’s a partridge.”</p>

<p>“No,” said I, a little disappointed at
her mistake, “that’s a pheasant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, the same thing,” said Bellwattle,
unperturbed.</p>

<p>“Of course; they both begin with a
P,” said I.</p>

<p>And then she looked at me out of the
corner of her eyes and blinked. I thank
God I did not smile. She would never
have believed in me again.</p>

<p>But it is when Bellwattle puts out
her gentle hand to help Nature in her
schemes that I think she is most lovable
of all. This is the way with all true
women when they love Nature for Nature’s
sake. In fact, it sometimes seems
to me, when I watch Bellwattle forestalling
God at every turn, that she is
Eve incarnate, the mother of all living.
For to see her in the garden and the
country, you would feel that she almost
believes she has suffered the labours of
maternity for every single thing that
lives, from the first snowdrop opening
its eyes to the spring to the last little
tremulous calf, with its quaking knees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
which the old cow in the farmyard presents
to our neighbour over the way.</p>

<p>“The poor wee mite,” she says, and
she gives it the tips of her fingers with
which to ease its toothless gums.</p>

<p>But sometimes, as woman will, she
carries this motherdom to excess. You
may aid Nature to a point. Men do it
in their pre-eminently practical way,
which has science for the dry heart of it.
Watch them pruning rose trees. I believe
they take a positive pleasure in the
knife. I am perfectly sure Bellwattle’s
garden would be a forest of briars were
it not that Cruikshank keeps locked
within a little drawer a knife with a
handle of horn, which he takes out in
the month of March, when Bellwattle
goes to pay a visit to her mother up in
town. In fact, the visit is arranged for
that purpose.</p>

<p>“I suppose it has to be done,” she
says, packing her trunk. “But it seems
a silly business to me that you should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
have to cut the arms and legs off a thing
before it can grow properly. They bore
roses last year. Why not this?”</p>

<p>But where Nature needs no aid, there
is Bellwattle ready with her ever-helping
hand. She constitutes herself in the
capacity of nurse to all the birds in the
garden.</p>

<p>Only this spring a linnet built its nest
in the yew tree that grows in our hedge.
In an unwise moment Cruikshank informed
her of it. She ran off at once
and counted the eggs. Five there were.
She had seen eggs before, but these
were the most beautiful that any bird
had ever laid in its life.</p>

<p>From that moment she became so
fussy and excitable that Cruikshank
was at a loss to know what to do with
her.</p>

<p>“She’ll drive the bird away,” said
Cruikshank to me.</p>

<p>“Well, tell her so,” said I.</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“She simply said, ‘The bird must
know that I don’t mean to do any
harm.’”</p>

<p>“No doubt she’s right,” said I. “I
don’t suppose there’s an animal in the
whole of creation that doesn’t recognise
the maternal instinct when it sees it.”</p>

<p>That was all very well while there
were only eggs to be reckoned with. But
when one morning Bellwattle went to
the nest and found five black little heads,
like five little Hottentots grown old and
grizzled, with shrivelled tufts of grey
hair, there was no containing her.</p>

<p>She clapped her hands. She danced
up and down and—</p>

<p>“Oh, the dears!” she cried. “Oh, the
little dears! I must give them something
to eat. What will they eat?”</p>

<p>I looked at Cruikshank. I had come
round that morning to count his rosebuds
with him—a weakness of his to
which he always succumbs. He tells me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
it is the only way he can justify his use
of the knife. I looked at him and he
looked at me.</p>

<p>“This is going too far,” he whispered.
“Can’t we put a stop to it?”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me,” said I, and Bellwattle,
hearing our whispers, turned
round and stared at us.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“We were talking,” said I.</p>

<p>“Yes, but what about?”</p>

<p>She was fired with suspicion.</p>

<p>“We were wondering the best thing
you could feed them with.”</p>

<p>Suspicion fell from her.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” she asked.
“Would corn be any good?”</p>

<p>Cruikshank blew his nose.</p>

<p>“A little bit solid,” he said dubiously.</p>

<p>“You can’t do better than give them
the same as their mother does,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Small worms,” I replied, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
watched her face; “those little thin, red,
raw ones.”</p>

<p>She walked away, saying nothing.
She hates worms. Well, naturally—every
woman does.</p>

<p>Cruikshank laid an appreciative hand
on my shoulder.</p>

<p>“That’s done it,” he said. “I was
afraid she’d go worrying about till she
made the poor little beast desert, but
that’s done it.”</p>

<p>I was not so sure myself. Therefore
it surprised me not at all the next morning
when, arriving unexpectedly in the
garden, I came upon her unawares,
carrying at arm’s length two little wriggling
worms. There was an expression
on her face which will live in my memory
for ever. I concealed myself behind
a tree and watched. I could see
nothing, but this is what I heard—</p>

<p>“Oh, you funny little mites! Bless
your little hearts! Here, take it—take
it! Open your mouth, you silly! Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
so wide—not so wide. Well, if you all
sit up like that you’ll fall out, you know.
Lie down, you silly little fools; lie down!
lie down! Now shut your mouth on it
and you’ll find it. Shut your mouth!”</p>

<p>And so on and so on, till my laughter
gave me away.</p>

<p>“Were you listening all the time?”
she asked.</p>

<p>I nodded my head.</p>

<p>“So was the mother linnet,” said I,
“up in that lilac tree. What do you
think she’ll do now? She’ll think you’ve
been trying to kill them.”</p>

<p>“No, she won’t,” said Bellwattle. “I
left a big worm on the edge of the nest
for her, so that she’ll know I’ve been
feeding them.”</p>

<p>But something worse than that happened.
With all this attention paid to
that which by every law of Nature
should have been kept a dead secret, the
attention of Bellwattle’s cat was attracted
to the spot. Next morning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
nest was found empty and one of those
brown little Hottentots hung dangling
in the branches.</p>

<p>Bellwattle came running down the
garden, wringing her hands, the tears
glittering in her eyes, her lips quivering
as she told us what had happened.</p>

<p>“That comes of meddling with Nature,”
began Cruikshank, but I stopped
him very quickly.</p>

<p>“If you stop her tears and make her
angry,” I whispered, “she’ll never forgive
you. Let her cry; it’s the way
women learn.”</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">X
<br />
<small>MAY EVE</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">I was told that some one wanted to see
me.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” I asked.</p>

<p>They told me it was an old lady, who
would give no name. I inquired of her
appearance. “She is an old lady,” they
replied, “and very, very small.” I think
I must have guessed, for I asked no further
questions. I told them to show
her in.</p>

<p>If I could only describe to you the
way she came into the room! She was
so wee and so tiny. Her eyes sparkled
with such brilliancy, she might have
been seven instead of seventy. Then,
when she bobbed me a curtsey as she
entered, I could have believed she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a fairy come from the uttermost ends of
the earth to attend a christening.</p>

<p>There was every good reason for my
belief, not the least of which was that it
was May Eve. In Ireland, as you know,
the folk dare not go out after dark on
this eventful day. The fairies are in the
fields, fairies good and bad, and heaven
only knows what you may not come
across if you wander through the
boreens or across the hillside when once
the evening has put on her mantle of
grey.</p>

<p>Not only will you meet them in the
fields, moreover; they come to your very
door and milk they ask of you, and fire
and water. Now, except that she asked
for nothing, but rather brought a gift
to me, my wee visitor might have been
a fairy come out of the land beyond the
edge of Time; come ten million miles to
this old farmhouse which hugs itself so
close to the land in the valley between
the hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>For the moment I felt my heart in
my throat. I had added things together
so quickly in my mind that I was sure
my belief was right. She was a fairy.
May Eve—the very time of day, when
the grey mist is creeping over the
meadows, and the river runs <em>blip, blip</em>
between the reeds—the strange and
youthful glitter in her wee brown eyes,
set deep in the hollows of that old and
wrinkled face; then last of all, her bobbing
curtsey and the way she smiled at
me as though she had a blessing in her
pocket—these were the things I added
so swiftly together in my mind. The
result was inevitable. Undoubtedly she
was a fairy. Now see how strange the
tricks life plays with you; for, whereas
I had believed in fairies before, I knew
now that my belief had been vain. I
had only believed in the idea of them—that
was all. I had only said I believed
because I knew I should never see one
to contradict the doubt which still lingered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in my heart. That is the way
most of us say our credo.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought you your travelling-rug,”
said she, and she bobbed again.</p>

<p>“What travelling-rug?” I asked.</p>

<p>And then, what happened, do you
think? I could hardly believe my eyes.
She took from off her arm what seemed
at first to me some garment, lined richly
with orange-coloured sateen. My eyes
grew wider in wonder as she laid it
down and spread it out upon the floor.</p>

<p>It was a patchwork quilt!</p>

<p>Oh, you never did see such a galaxy
of colours in all your life! Blues and
reds, greens, yellows and purples, they
all jostled each other for a place upon
that square of orange-coloured sateen.
All textures they were, too; some velvet,
some silk, and some brocade. It was as
if the caves of Aladdin had been thrown
open to me, and I were allowed just for
one moment to peep within.</p>

<p>But that was not all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>For when I said: “You’ve finished
it, then?” I saw to what purpose
that completion had been made.
Right in the centre of all those
dazzling patches was a square of
purple—purple that the Emperors used
to wear—while worked across in regal
letters of gold there were my own
initials.</p>

<p>I stared at them. I went down on my
knees, looking close into the stitches to
make sure that there was no mistake.
Then I gazed up at her.</p>

<p>“But it’s for me?” said I.</p>

<p>She nodded her head and her whole
face was lighted up with pride and satisfaction.
She was so excited, too. Her
eyes danced with excitement. You
know the quaint little twisted attitudes
that children get into when they are
giving you a present which they have
made themselves; they are half consumed
with fear that you are going to
laugh at them and half consumed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
pride in their own handiwork. She was
just like that.</p>

<p>Lest you do not know already, I
should tell you that I had made her my
pensioner as long as she lives, in order
to enable her to leave off work and make
this patchwork quilt whereby she might
be remembered by those who slept beneath
it when she had gone to sleep.
But I had thought to myself, surely it
will be in the family. I had wondered
who would become the proud possessor
of it. Imagine my amazement, then,
when I realised that it was my very
own.</p>

<p>“And you’ll think of me when I’m
gone, won’t you, sir—when you go to
bed at night?” she said.</p>

<p>“Think of you?” said I. “You may
well call it a travelling-rug. I only have
to wrap this round me and, with the
mere wish of it, I shall be in the land of
dreams—millions and millions of miles
away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“P’raps I shall be there, too,” said
she, clasping her hands.</p>

<p>“And then we’ll meet,” said I.</p>

<p>She began folding it up with just that
care which she had used in the making
of it. She folded it one way.</p>

<p>“It’s nice and warm,” said she.</p>

<p>She doubled it another way.</p>

<p>“Every one of the squares is lined
with sateen.”</p>

<p>She redoubled it once more.</p>

<p>“And it’s all padded with cotton
wool.”</p>

<p>When she said that, she stood up with
her face all beaming with smiles, and
she laid it in my hands.</p>

<p>Then I did what I had wanted to do
from the very first moment I saw her.
I took her little face in my hands and I
kissed the soft, warm, wrinkled cheeks.</p>

<p>“When I was very unhappy,” said I,
“I used to entertain what is called a belief
in fairies. Now that I know what it
is to be happy, I find them. It’s a very
different thing.”</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">XI
<br />
<small>THE FLOWER BEAUTIFUL</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">Limehouse, Plaistow, and the East
India Docks—these are places in the
world to wonder about. Yet even there
beauty manages to creep in and grow
in a soil where there would seem to be
nothing but decay.</p>

<p>There are societies, I believe, which
exist in those quarters, whose endeavour
it is to lift the mind of the East
End inhabitant to an appreciation of
what the West End knows to be Art. I
am sure that all their intentions are
the sincerest in the world. But what is
the good of Art to a dock labourer and
his wife?</p>

<p>We have only arrived at Art ourselves
after generations and generations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of a knowledge of what is beautiful. So
absolutely have we arrived, moreover,
that we care no longer for what is beautiful;
we only care for Art.</p>

<p>That, however, is another question
too long to enter into here. But to teach
Art to the East India dock labourer
when he knows so little of beauty, that
is a process of putting carts before
horses—a reduction to absurdity which
can be seen at once.</p>

<p>Now when I was a journalist—that
is to say, when I wrote lines of words
for a paper which paid me so much per
line for the number of lines which the
chief sub-editor was good enough to use—I
was one day despatched to the East
End to see if there were any stuff—I
speak colloquially—in a poor people’s
flower show.</p>

<p>“It may be funny,” said the editor.</p>

<p>“It might be,” said I.</p>

<p>“Well, make it funny,” said he, for I
think he caught the note in my voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>I pocketed my notebook and set off
for the East End. Oh, there were all
sorts of flowers and doubtless it looked
the funniest of flower shows you would
ever have seen. For example, the
qualification necessary for exhibition
was that your plant had been grown
in a pot and on a window sill. It was
a qualification not difficult to fulfil.
In all my wanderings there to find
the place, no plot of ground did I
see, save a graveyard around a
church. But the only things that grew
there were the stones in memory of
the dead; and they, begrimed with soot
and dirt, were sorry flowers to grace
a tomb.</p>

<p>You can imagine the pitiful, shrivelled
little things that had struggled
to maintain life on the window sills of
the houses in those dingy courts and
darksome alleys. Never did I see such
an array in all my life. They would almost,
when you thought of country gardens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
where the daffodils stand up and
brave the April winds, they would almost
have brought the tears to your
eyes.</p>

<p>Little geraniums there were, blinking
their poor, tired eyes at the light. One
woman brought a plant of sweet pea,
which was climbing so wearily, yet so
anxiously out of its little pot of red up
a wee thin stake of wood. You knew
it would never reach the light of the
heaven it so yearned to see. The two
faint blossoms that it bore were pale,
like fragile slum children. What would
I not have given then to wrench it out
of its poor bed and give it to the great
generous sweep of an open field, with a
hedge of hawthorn perhaps on which to
lean its tired arms.</p>

<p>The woman saw my eyes in its direction
and she beamed with conscious
pride.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look very healthy,” said
I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>She gazed at it and then at me with
open wonder in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Not ’ealthy?” she said—“why, I’ve
never seen none looking better. Look
at that pansy over there—it can’t ’old
its ’ead up.”</p>

<p>“But why compare it with the worst
one in the show?” I asked—“I didn’t
mean it as a personal criticism when I
said it wasn’t healthy. I’m sure you’ve
taken a tremendous amount of care
over it.”</p>

<p>“Care!” she exclaimed—“I should
just think I ’ave. It’s ’ad all the scrapin’s
off the road in front of our ’ouse.”</p>

<p>I passed on, for the judges were coming
round and the young curate just
down from the university has not a
proper respect for the Press. He has
probably written for it. Now the young
curate of the parish was the principal
judge.</p>

<p>I did not hear what he said about
the sweet pea. I had gone further on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to where a woman was standing with
her hand affectionately round a pot
from which rose a fine, healthy plant,
with rich, deep purple flowers nestling
in the leaves that grew to the very
pinnacle of the stem. There I waited.
I wanted to hear what the judges were
going to say about this one. I wanted
to hear very much indeed.</p>

<p>This woman, too, seeing my interest
in her exhibit, smiled with generous
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Think I’ve got a chanst, sir?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said I—“it’s fine and
strong.”</p>

<p>“And look at all the blossoms,” said
she with enthusiasm—“you wouldn’t
believe it, but my son brought that from
the country last year when ’e went for
the houtin’. ’E brought it back, dragged
up almost to the roots it was—an’
it was in flower then. ‘Put it in a
vawse,’ I says, but my ole man, ’e says—‘Shove
it in a bloomin’ pot,’ ’e says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
‘that’ll grow,’ ’e says—‘it’s got roots to
it.’ So we puts it in a pot and sticks it
out on a window sill, and there it is. It
died down to nothin’ last winter, but my
ole man, ’e wouldn’t let me throw the pot
away. ‘Give it a chanst of the spring,’
’e says—‘give it a chanst of the spring.’
And bless my soul, if we didn’t see
little bits of green sticking up through
the mould before the beginning of last
March.”</p>

<p>“It’s been a constant interest since
then?” said I.</p>

<p>“Hinterest! Why my ole man said
as I was killin’ it, the way I watered it
and looked after it.”</p>

<p>“And what do you call it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it is,” she said.
“Nobody seems to know. We call it—William.”</p>

<p>I laughed. “There is a flower called
Sweet William,” said I.</p>

<p>“Perhaps that’s it,” she answered,
thoughtfully. “But it don’t smell—leastways,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
I’ve never smelt nothin’ from
it.”</p>

<p>I stood aside as the judges came up.
When he saw the plant, standing so
bravely and so healthily, and so beautifully
in its bright red pot, the curate
laughed out loud.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said he to one of the
other judges, who came up and laughed
as well.</p>

<p>“Do you know what you’ve got here,
my good woman?” asked the curate.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t give you anything
for this—it’s only a common nettle—a
red dead nettle.”</p>

<p>“But it’s a beautiful colour—ain’t it?”
said she, with a flame of red in her face.</p>

<p>“Oh—it’s a beautiful colour, no
doubt,” replied the curate easily—“so, I
hope, is every plant that grows in the
highways and the byways.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, why shouldn’t it get a
prize?” she demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because it’s only a common dead
nettle,” said the curate, very softly,
turning away wrath.</p>

<p>“But it’s ’ealthier and stronger and
finer than any o’ them other flowers,”
said she.</p>

<p>“Quite so—no doubt—you might expect
that. These others are cultivated
flowers, you see. This is only a common
dead nettle.”</p>

<p>I saw the editor when I returned.</p>

<p>“No stuff worth having,” said I—disconsolately,
for I was thinking of my
few short lines.</p>

<p>“Nothing funny at all?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said I, and I told him
about the red dead nettle.</p>

<p>“But I think that’s dammed funny,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Do you?” I said.</p>

<small>THE FEMININE APPRECIATION

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">XII
<br />
<small>THE FEMININE APPRECIATION OF
MATHEMATICS</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">If I could approach mathematics with
the same spirit as do ninety-eight
women out of a hundred, I might be
rather good at them. As it is, my power
of will in face of algebraical figures, in
face even of numbers that exceed the
functions of the simplest forms of
arithmetic, my power of will stands
aghast. I can do nothing.</p>

<p>Now, ninety-eight women out of a
hundred are far more ignorant of the
mere rudiments of mathematics than
am I; yet with an instinct which I
would give my soul to possess they can
solve problems and carry on the ordinary
business of life with an ability that
is little short of marvellous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Truly, a little learning is a dangerous
thing, and most especially when that
learning is of mathematics. If once
you have tried to weigh hydrogen on
an agate-balanced scale, you are for
ever unfitted for the common-or-garden
mathematical exigencies of life. Now
this is where a woman has all the pull.
The most that she has ever had to calculate
the weight of is a pound of flour
or seven and a half pounds of sirloin
already weighed and attested by the
butcher. When, then, it comes to weighing
the baby on the scale-pans in the
kitchen, she will fling on the weights
with such a degree of confidence that
the result is bound to be correct. You
and I, on the other hand, would approach
the matter with such delicacy of
touch—believing, and quite rightly, that
a baby was of far more importance than
all the immeasurable quantities of
hydrogen in the world—with such
delicacy and care should we approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
it that the poor infant would have
caught its death of cold and be in a comatose
condition of exhaustion before we
had decided that the scale-pan was clean
or the weights were in proper condition
to be used.</p>

<p>This smattering of general education
is a fatal business. It unfits men for all
the real and useful demands of life.</p>

<p>Only the other day, my friend Cruikshank
broke a brass candlestick and
looked up helplessly from the wreck.</p>

<p>“Where on earth can I get any solder
from?” said he.</p>

<p>“What’s solder?” asked Bellwattle,
his wife.</p>

<p>The question was so direct that, for
the moment, it confused him.</p>

<p>“Solder?” he repeated. “Solder?
Oh, it’s stuff to mend metal with.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it with sealing-wax,” said
Bellwattle.</p>

<p>Cruikshank laughed and, as he said to
me afterwards—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“I gave it to her to do. It’s best to
let women learn by experience. Sealing-wax!”
And he laughed knowingly at
me. I knew he meant it kindly, so I
laughed with him; but the next day I
made inquiries about the candlestick.</p>

<p>“How did she get on?” I asked.</p>

<p>“By Jove, she’s done it,” said he. “It
won’t bear much knocking about, of
course, but it stands as firm as a rock.
It’s only a woman,” he added, “who’d
think of mending a brass candlestick
with sealing-wax.”</p>

<p>“It’s only a woman who’d succeed,”
said I.</p>

<p>But this has nothing to do with
mathematics, and it is of mathematics
that I want to speak.</p>

<p>If you have any interest in photography,
you know how tricksy a matter
is the exposure of a plate. It is tricksy
to you and I will tell you why. It is
because your academic study of the process
has taught you that the two-thousandth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
part of a second is sufficient exposure
in order to get cloud effects.
Conceive, then, how your brain whirls
with figures when you come to take a
photograph of an interior or a portrait
of some one sitting in a room. I will
not remind you of the tortures which
your mind must suffer, nor the result of
such torture when at last you develop
the plate in the dark-room—both are
too painful to speak about. Now, a
woman knows nothing about this two-thousandth
part of a second. She would
not believe there were such a measurable
fraction of time if you told her. She
just exposes the plate; that is all.</p>

<p>One day I had to get a photograph
taken in a hurry. I marched into a
photographer’s in the Strand. There
was first a narrow passage, hung with
frames filled with photos of young men
and young women looking their worst
in their best. Then I was confronted by
a flight of stairs which I mounted, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
find myself in a great big room hung
also with photographs—photographs of
family groups, of babies in their characteristic
attitudes as their mothers had
given them to the world. Every conceivable
sort of photograph was there,
but the room, except for an American
roll-topped desk near the window, was
empty.</p>

<p>I coughed, and the head of a young
girl—not more than twenty years of
age—popped up above the desk.</p>

<p>“Can Mr. Robinson take my photograph
this morning?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Mr. Robinson is not in at present,”
she replied.</p>

<p>“I rather wanted my photograph
taken in a hurry,” said I.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can have it taken,” said
she. “Would you like it done at
once?”</p>

<p>“At once, if you please,” I answered.</p>

<p>She rose from her seat behind the
roll-topped desk and she walked to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
door.</p>

<p>“Then will you step into the waiting-room?”
she asked.</p>

<p>I obeyed. The waiting-room had a
mirror and a pair of brushes. When
I thought of the families whose portraits
I had seen within—I refrained.</p>

<p>“I shall do,” said I, “as I am.”</p>

<p>After a few moments’ delay there
was a knock on the door. I opened it.
There again was the little lady waiting
for me.</p>

<p>“Will you step up to the studio,
please?” she said, and I received the
impression from her voice of anxious
assistants waiting in rows to receive
me, ready to take my features and record
them upon a photographic plate
for the benefit of posterity.</p>

<p>Up into the studio, then, I went; a
gaunt, great place with white-blinded
windows that stared up to the dull, grey
sky. But it was empty. I looked in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
vain for the assistants—there were
none. And when she began to wheel
the camera into place I stood amazed.</p>

<p>“Are you the whole business of
Robinson and Co.?” I asked.</p>

<p>She smiled encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Robinson is out,” said she.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there is a Mr. Robinson,”
I replied.</p>

<p>She laughed gleefully at that and repeated
that there was such a person, but
he was out.</p>

<p>“And does he leave you to the responsibility
of the entire premises?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she.</p>

<p>“What do you do if any one comes
into the portrait gallery downstairs
while you’re up here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” she replied confidently;
“they don’t often come.”</p>

<p>I let her fix that abominable instrument
of torture at the back of my neck.
Her fingers tickled me as she did it, but
I said nothing. I was trying in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
mind to assess the value of this business
of Mr. Robinson. It was no easy job.
I had not got beyond single figures
when she walked back to the camera.</p>

<p>I glanced up at the leaden sky.</p>

<p>“It’s rather dull,” said I; “what exposure
are you going to give?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think once will be enough.”</p>

<p>“Once what?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Just once,” said she.</p>

<p>“But, good heavens!” I exclaimed,
and I thought of the two-thousandth
part of a second—“it must be one of
something. Is it seconds or minutes or
half-hours or what?”</p>

<p>She burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it is,” she replied,
as if it were the simplest matter in the
world, “only Mr. Robinson says my
once is as good as his twice.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” said I. “As good as his
twice? What a splendid once it must
be!”</p>

<p>Now that is what I mean. That is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the feminine appreciation of mathematics.
I wish I had it. It may not
be of much service on the office stool,
but in a world of men and women it
is invaluable.</p>

<small>THE MATERNAL INSTINCT</small></h2>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">XIII
<br />
<small>THE MATERNAL INSTINCT</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">Some things there are which you may
count upon for ever. The fittest will always
survive, despite the million charities
to aid the incompetent; the maternal
instinct will always be the deepest human
incentive, no matter who may gibe
at the sentiment which clings about little
children.</p>

<p>Now, if it be true that Art is the
voice of the Age in which we live; that
the painter paints what the eye of the
Age has seen, the singer sings the songs
which the Age has heard, the man of
letters writes the thoughts which have
passed through the mind of the Age—if
all this is true, then how strange
and unreal an Age this must be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>For if for one moment you chose
to consider it, there are but few
painters, few singers, few writers who
express the immutable laws of life.
Among writers most of all, perhaps,
this is an age which devotes itself to
the unfittest. The physically unfit, the
morally unfit, the socially unfit—these
are the characters which fill the pages
of those who write to-day.</p>

<p>The old hero, the man of great
strength, of great honour, of great
courage, he no longer exists in literature.
I am told he is old-fashioned,
a copy-book individual, a puppet set in
motion with no subtle movements of
character, but with wires too plainly
seen, worked by a hand too obviously
visible. There is no Art in him, I am
told. I am glad there is not. He would
lose all the qualities of heroship for me
if there were.</p>

<p>In times gone by, though, this old-fashioned
hero was just as real a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
as is the hero of to-day. In times gone
by this hero was not unnatural, not
wanting in character or humanity when
he slept with the maid of his choice, a
naked sword between them guarding
the pricelessness of her virginity. But
now—to-day—how wanting in character
do you imagine would he be thought
for such a deed as that? How painfully
unreal?</p>

<p>Is this the fault of the Age? Or is
it the fault of the writer? Is it that the
Age cannot produce a real hero? Or is
it that he is there in numbers in the
midst of us and the man of letters has
not the clearness of vision to see him?
For it is not the fittest, but the unfittest
who survives in the pages of literature
now.</p>

<p>And thus it is also when you find
treatment in fiction of that immutable
law, the maternal instinct. If in the
novel of to-day you meet the character
of a woman with a child, you may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
fairly confident that it will be shown
to you sooner or later in the ensuing
pages how easily she will desert it for
the love of some man other than her
husband, or how, loving that man, her
soul will be wracked ere she bids it
farewell. But, tortured or not, she will
go. No matter how skilfully she is
shown to repent of it later, still she will
go.</p>

<p>Now, is that the fault of the Age,
or is it the fault of the writer? In
danger or in love, do women desert
their children? It may happen that
they do, but that is a very different
matter. All that glitters is not gold—all
that happens is not real. Yet it
seems to be the choice of the modern
writer to seize upon these isolated happenings,
give them a coating of reality,
and offer them to the public as life.</p>

<p>But life is not a narrow business
where things just happen and that is
all. Life is the length and breadth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
this great universe where things are,
in relation to the whole system of suns
and moons and stars. Now the maternal
instinct is a law without which this
wonderfully regulated system would
shatter and crumble into a thousand little
pieces.</p>

<p>But no one extols it in this age of
ours. Talk of it and you are dubbed
a sentimentalist at once. Write of it
and the cheap irony of critics is heaped
upon you. Yet there seems no greater
and no grander struggle to me than
when these inevitable laws march
through the invading army of vermin
and of parasites to their inevitable end
of victory.</p>

<p>The other day I witnessed a most
thrilling spectacle: a mother defending
her child from death—a duel where the
odds against victory were legion.</p>

<p>In the hedge that shields my garden
from the road there is a thrush’s nest.
I saw her build it. She was very doubtful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
about me at first; played all sorts of
tricks to deceive me; decoyed my attention
away while her mate was a-building;
sent him to distract my mind while
she was putting those finishing touches
to the house of which only a woman
knows the secret—and knows it so well.</p>

<p>I think before it was completed she
had lost much of her distrust in me, for
I did nothing to disturb her. It was not
in my mind to see what she would do if
things happened. I just wanted everything
to be—that was all. And so, after
a time, she would hop about the lawn
where I was sitting, taking me silently
thereby into her confidence, making me
feel that I was not such an outcast of
Nature as she had supposed me to be
at first.</p>

<p>I tried to live up to that as well as
I could. Whenever I passed the nest
and saw her uplifted beak, her two
watchful eyes gazing alert over the
rim of it, I assumed ignorance at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
expense of her thinking what an unobservant
fool I must be. But there
were always moments when she was
away from home and I, stealing to the
nest, found opportunity for discovering
how things were going on. Five fine
blue eggs were laid at last. I think she
must have guessed that I counted them,
for one morning she caught me with my
hand in the nest. I slunk away feeling
a sorry sort of fool for my clumsy interference.
She flew at once to see what
I had done. I guess the terror that must
have filled her heart. But when she had
counted them herself and found her
house in order, she came out on to the
lawn and looked at me as though I were
one of those strange enigmas which
life sometimes offers to every one
of us.</p>

<p>At length one day, when I called
and gently put in my hand—leaving
my card, as you might say—the eggs
were there no longer. In place of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
was a soft, warm mass like a heap of
swan’s-down, palpitating with life.</p>

<p>I met her later on the lawn, when
she perked her head up at me and as
good as said:</p>

<p>“I suppose you know I’ve got other
things to do now, besides looking beautiful.”</p>

<p>But I thought she looked splendid.
What is more, I told her so, and it
seemed just for the moment as if she
understood, as if there came back into
her eyes that look of grateful vanity
which she wore last spring when her
mate was wooing her with his songs
from the elm tree across the way. But
the next moment she had put all flattery
behind her and was haggling with a
worm, not as to price no doubt, but haggling
nevertheless for possession.</p>

<p>Well, the household went on splendidly,
until one day I saw my cat sitting
on the path below the nest staring up
into the bushes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“You little devil!” I shouted, and she
went galloping down the garden with a
stone trundling at her heels.</p>

<p>I kept a closer watch after that and,
one morning, hearing a great noise as of
the songs of many birds while I was at
my breakfast, I just stepped out to see
what was happening.</p>

<p>I was held spellbound by what I saw.
For there, on the path again below the
nest, sat the cat and two yards from her—scarcely
more—stood my little
mother-thrush, her eyes dilated with
terror, her feathers ruffled and swelling
on her throat, singing—singing—singing,
as though her heart would burst.</p>

<p>It can only last a moment, I thought.
One spring and the cat will have her.
But, no! Before the greatness of that
courage, before the glory of that song,
the cat was silenced and made impotent
to move. There, within a few feet of
her was her prey. With one swift rush,
with one fell stroke of her velvet paw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
she could have laid it low. But she was
up against a law greater than that which
nerves the hunter to his cunning.</p>

<p>For five minutes, with throat swelling
and eyes like little pins of fire, the
mother sang her song of fearless maternity.
The glorious notes rang from her
in ceaseless trills and tireless cadences.
I have heard a singer at Covent Garden,
when the whole house rose as one
person and applauded her to the very
roof, but never have I heard such a song
as this, which put to silence the very
laws of God that His greatest law might
triumph.</p>

<p>For five minutes she sang and then,
with crouching steps, the cat turned tail
and crawled away into the garden. The
thrush ceased her singing and fluttered
exhausted up to the nest.</p>

<p>And they write of women deserting
their children!</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">XIV
<br />
<small>FROM MY PORTFOLIO</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">He has just reached his eightieth year.
Eighty times—not conscious perhaps of
them all—he has seen the wall-flowers
blossom in his old garden; well-nigh
eighty times has he thinned out his lettuces
and his spring onions, pruned his
few rose trees, weeded his gravel paths.</p>

<p>Now he is bent with rheumatism;
his rounded back and stooping head,
his tremulous knees in their old corduroy
breeches, are but sorry promises of
what he was. Yet with what I have
been told and what I can easily imagine,
it is plainly that I can see the fine stalwart
fellow he has been. Until the age
of seventy-two he was the carrier for
our village. How many journeys he
made, fair weather or foul, always up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to the stroke of time, never forgetting
the message for this person, the purchase
for that, they will all tell you here
in the village. I know nothing of his
life as a carrier. It is of an old man I
give you my picture—an old man awaiting
the coming of death with a clear
eye and a sturdy heart, enjoying the
last moments of life while he may, and
facing those sorrows and deprivations
which come with old age in a way that
many a younger man might learn and
profit from.</p>

<p>Only a short time since, his wife departed
upon her last journey. The
winter came and snatched her from
him just as the first frost nips the last
of the autumn flowers. Her frail white
petals drooped and then they fell. He
was left to press them between the
leaves of that book of Life which, with
trembling fingers, he still clutched within
his hand.</p>

<p>He was too ill to follow her body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to its quiet little bed in that corner of
God’s acre where it was made; but
I can feel the loneliness in the heart of
him when he turned and turned with
wakeful eyes that night, stretching out
his knotted fingers to the empty place
beside him—the place in that bed which
had been hers for so many happy years
and was hers no longer.</p>

<p>They thought he would never pull
through that winter after his loss; and
indeed he must have fought manfully
with that undaunted courage of a man
who clings to life, no matter what misfortune,
because it is his right—his heritage.
For imagine the long, sleepless
nights which must have followed the
departure of his gentle bed-fellow!
Think of those weary, endless silences
which once had been filled by the whisperings
of their voices! For in bed and
at night-time, the old people always
whisper. It is as though they were
deeply conscious of the invisible presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of God and His angels. They talk
in hushed voices as though they were
in church.</p>

<p>I can hear her saying—</p>

<p>“John.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I can hear him reply.</p>

<p>“Are you awake?”</p>

<p>“Yes—are you?”</p>

<p>“I am. Isn’t it a windy night?”</p>

<p>“’Tis a fine storm—and I never put
in they pea-sticks. I was going to do ’en
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>And then I can hear her little whisper
of consolation—</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ll be safe till then.
They’re sturdy plants.” At which I can
see him turning over in his bed and
passing into one of those short hours of
sleep into which Nature so gently divides
the night for the old people.</p>

<p>Then think of the long and weary
silences through which he must have
endured before he grew accustomed to
the absence of his bed-fellow. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
there seem to me few things more
pathetic yet more beautiful than two
old people who have long passed the
passions of youth, sharing their bed
together, with the simplicity and innocence
of little children. I can, too, so
readily conceive how dread the terror
of the night becomes when one of them
is taken and the other left. I can hear
the sounds at night that frighten, the
storms that rattle the tiles on the old
roof making the one who is left behind
stretch out his groping hand for the
trembling touch of another hand in vain.</p>

<p>Yet through all this he survived.
Cruelly though his heart had been
dealt with, he still retained the whole
spirit of courage in his soul. With all
its chill winds and bitter frosts, he
braved out that winter and two years
have passed now since his wife died.</p>

<p>I see him nearly every day in his
garden, walking up and down the paths,
picking out a weed here, a weed there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Two walking-sticks he has to help him
on his journeys. They are called
simply, number one and number two.
And when it is a fine morning, with the
sun riding fiercely in a cloudless sky, his
daughter will say to him—</p>

<p>“You need only take number one to-day.”</p>

<p>So he takes number one and a look
comes into those child’s eyes of his as
though he would say—</p>

<p>“Ah—you see I’m not done for yet.
There’s many an old fellow of eighty
can’t get along without two sticks to
help him.”</p>

<p>One day, too, this summer, I found
him working with a bill-hook in his garden.
The grass had grown up high
under the quick-set hedge on one of the
paths. He was clearing it all away.</p>

<p>“Must keep the little place tidy, sir,”
he said, with a bright twinkle in his eye.
“They grasses do grow up so quick
there’d be no seeing the path at all.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Then with little suppressed grunts of his
breath to every swing of the bill-hook,
he went on steadily with his work, leaning
heavily upon number one with the
other hand.</p>

<p>Rather strenuous labour you would
think for an old man of eighty to be
doing. But as he worked, I saw that
all the stems of the grass had been cut
for him beforehand with a scythe. He
was only sweeping it together into heaps
with the aid of a bill-hook. So long as it
was a bill-hook it seemed man’s labour
to him.</p>

<p>I try sometimes to find out what he
thinks about life and its swiftly approaching
end. But he is very reticent
to speak of it—so unlike our little serving-maid,
who takes her evenings out
alone, and when I asked her why she did
not prefer company, replied—</p>

<p>“I like to think, sir.”</p>

<p>“What of?” said I.</p>

<p>“Of life and the night,” said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>But if he thinks of life and the night,
as indeed I am sure he must, he tells
his thoughts to no one. It was only
once, when I was praising the scent and
the show of his glorious wall-flowers,
that he said to me—</p>

<p>“I like to think they’re the best this
year that I’ve ever had. I grow them all
from our own seed, sir. I save it up
myself every year. And I like to think
this year that they’re the very best, because
you know, sir, I may not see them
again.”</p>

<p>I tried to imagine what would be the
state of my own mind, if I thought I
should never see wall-flowers again. I
wondered could I say it with such courage,
such resignation as he.</p>

<p>To never see wall-flowers again! It
seems in a nonsensical, childish way to
me to sum up the whole tragedy—if
tragedy there really be—in Death. It
seems, moreover, to give just that little
stroke of the brush, that little line of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
pen in completion of this thumb-nail
portrait of mine. An old man in an old
garden that he loves, telling himself that
his wall-flowers are the best that year of
all—telling himself bravely night after
night when he goes to bed, morning
after morning when he rises to the new
day—which is one more day nearer the
end—telling himself that they are the
best this year of all, because he may not
see them any more.</p>

<p>To never see wall-flowers again!</p>

<small>AN OLD STRING BONNET</small></h2>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">XV
<br />
<small>AN OLD STRING BONNET</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">I care not what it is, so long as it be old;
but if an object has passed through
other hands than mine, it gathers an indefinable
charm about it. Old china,
old cups and saucers, whether they be
ugly or beautiful, are priceless by reason
of that faint murmuring of other
lives which clings around them. In the
mere tinkling of the china as it is
brought in upon the tray, I can hear a
thousand conversations and gossipings
coming dimly to my ears out of the
wealth of years which is heaped upon
them.</p>

<p>For this reason would I always use
the old china which it is my good fortune
to possess. A breakfast-table, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
tea-table spread with china which can
tell you nothing than that it has but
lately come from the grimy potteries,
makes poor company to sit down with.
Yet let it be but Spode, or Worcester, or
Lowestoft, and every silence that falls
upon you is filled with the whisperings
of these priceless companions.</p>

<p>I have no sympathy with the collector
who locks his china away because it is
rare and worth so much in pounds and
shillings and pence. He is no more than
a gaoler, incarcerating in an eternal
prison the very best friends he has, and
just, if you please, because they are his.</p>

<p>What if there is the risk of their being
broken! A rivet here, a rivet there will
make them speak again. I have a Spode
milk-jug with forty-five rivets in it and
it is more eloquent to me than all the
modern china you could find, however
perfect it may be. In fact, I would
sooner have a piece that has been
mended. It shows that in those long-ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
days, where all romance lies hiding
for us now, it shows that they cared for
their treasures and would not let them
be discarded because they happened
upon evil times. I have also an old blue
and white tea-pot with a silver spout.
A dealer sniffed at it the other day.</p>

<p>“May have been good once,” said he.</p>

<p>“’Tis better now,” said I. “So would
you and I be if we’d been through the
wars.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you’d prefer me
with a wooden arm?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I would,” said I. “You’d be a better
man. You couldn’t grasp so much.”</p>

<p>But the other day I found a treasure.
Miss B——, the old spinster lady in
whose farm I have my little dwelling, is
by way of being the reincarnation of a
jackdaw. She has cupboards and chests
in every room in which lie hidden a
thousand old things which have been in
her family for years. Yesterday, in
turning out an old drawer, I came across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
a quaint little contrivance that looked
like a string bag, only it was beautifully
made in three parts, all composed of a
wonderful lace-work of fine string and
knitted together, each one by a delicate
stitching of white horsehair.</p>

<p>I brought it out into the kitchen, tenderly
in my hand.</p>

<p>“Whatever is this?” I asked.</p>

<p>She took it in her fingers and looked
at it for a moment, then, inconsequently,
she laid it down upon the kitchen table.</p>

<p>“That—” said she, “that was my
great, great grandmother’s bonnet. She
wore it up till the time she died.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s nearly two hundred years
old!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“If it’s a day,” said she.</p>

<p>I gazed at it for some moments. Then
suddenly it seemed to move, to raise
itself from the table. Another instant
and it was spread out, decked with a
tiny piece of pink ribbon, on the head
of an old lady—but oh, so old! Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
silvery white hair thrust out in little
curls and coils through the mesh of the
string, and there she was, with a great
broad skirt and big puff sleeves bobbing
me a curtsey before my very eyes.</p>

<p>I turned to Miss B——</p>

<p>“Do you see?” I asked.</p>

<p>“See what?” said she.</p>

<p>“Your great, great grandmother.”</p>

<p>“I never saw her in my life,” she replied.</p>

<p>“But under the string bonnet!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Goodness! That ’ud fall to pieces if
any one tried to put it on now. It’s no
good to me. You can have it if you
like.”</p>

<p>Then I understood why she could not
see her great, great grandmother, and,
with a feeling of compassion for her
loneliness, I took the old lady into my
arms. Miss B—— went to the sink to
peel some potatoes.</p>

<p>“You’re perfectly beautiful,” I whispered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and her old face wrinkled all over
with smiles.</p>

<p>“They used to tell me that when I was
a girl,” said she.</p>

<p>“You’re more beautiful now,” said I.</p>

<p>“What’s that you’re saying?” asked
Miss B—— over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“What I should have said,” said I, “if
I’d lived two hundred years ago.”</p>

<br />
<small>THE NEW MALADY</small></h2>

</div>




<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">XVI
<br />
<small>THE NEW MALADY</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">In every age there is a new disease—there
is a new malady—a strange sickness.
The whole army of medical science
goes out to meet it and there is
pitched a battle wherein lives are sacrificed,
honour made and lost. But in the
end the glorious banner of medical skill
is generally carried triumphant from
the field. Some old foes truly there are
who are not conquered yet, with whom
a guerilla warfare is continuously being
waged. Never can they be brought into
the open field; never can they be come
upon at close quarters. Sometimes in a
skirmish they are routed and put to
flight; yet ever they return, lessened
in numbers, no doubt, weakened in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
strength, but still a marauding enemy
to mankind.</p>

<p>Then apart from these, there is that
new malady, which, with its stern inevitability,
the age always brings amidst
its retinue of civilisation.</p>

<p>It would seem, notwithstanding the
dictum of the Bab Ballad-maker, that
they are not always blessings which follow
in Civilisation’s train. One disease
after another has come amongst us from
out the ranks of civilisation. And now
appears the latest of all, seizing upon
its victims under the very walls of that
fortress of medical science.</p>

<p>It is the disease of bearing children,
the disease of making life.</p>

<p>We all know how science with its
anæsthetics, with its deftly made instruments
and its consummate skill, is attacking
the enemy from every quarter.
Yet the fatality of the sickness is steadily
growing. More women die in childbirth
now than ever fell its victims in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the days when the services of a common
mid-wife were all that were at their disposal.</p>

<p>It is terrible sometimes to think how
rapidly this most natural of all functions—since
upon it hangs the existence
of all people in the world—it is terrible
to think how rapidly it is shaping into
the awesome features of a disease.
Women are as ashamed of its conditions
now as they would be if smallpox had
pitted their delicate skins. They speak
of it as of some dreadful operation—which
indeed it has become—and, instead
of glorying over a possession
which they alone command, they will
talk of it as a curse which, suffering
alone, they should be given compensation
for. They ask for the vote! Great
God! As if the vote could compensate
them for the loss of bearing children as
the God of nature meant they should be
borne! As if any form of compensation
could ease such a loss as that!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Success and civilisation—these are
the two subtle poisons from the effects
of which we are all suffering. Nothing
fails like success! Nothing degrades
so much as civilisation!</p>

<p>A little while ago a woman who had
given birth to a fine child told me quite
frankly that she herself was not going
to feed it.</p>

<p>“Do you mean suckle it?” said I.</p>

<p>She did not like that word and she
shuddered.</p>

<p>“You object to the use of the word?”
I suggested.</p>

<p>“Is it <em>quite</em> nice?” she asked.</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p>“Words are only ugly,” said I, “when
they express ugly deeds. I can understand
if you find the deed ugly you don’t
like the word.”</p>

<p>She answered that she did not mind
the thing itself. “You see,” said she,
“it’s quite impossible for me to do it.
We’ve been asked up—my husband and
I—to Chatsworth to meet the King, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
it would be foolish to lose such an opportunity—wouldn’t
it? I can’t go up
like this, so I must have a sort of operation.”</p>

<p>“So you’ve made up your mind?”
said I.</p>

<p>She screwed up her eyes as her conscience
faltered in her breast.</p>

<p>“Practically,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Well, if not quite,” I suggested,
“write to the King, and ask him whether
he would sooner meet you at Chatsworth
or have a stalwart son given to
the country.”</p>

<p>She told me I made the most absurd
remarks she had ever heard from any
one and she walked away. “Besides,”
said she, over her shoulder, “it’s a
daughter.”</p>

<p>I found her name amongst those invited
to Chatsworth to meet the King.
I saw her picture in a photograph of the
Chatsworth group and she looked beautiful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Her figure was that of a child
who had never known maternity.</p>

<p>There are traitors even in the camp
of medical science, thought I. Nothing
degrades science so much as the march
of civilisation—no social woman fails
so utterly as when she succeeds in meeting
the King.</p>

<p>I have a friend, in the tiny chintz
parlour of whose cottage in the country
a certain collection of prints adorn the
walls. For the most part they are steel
engravings, valuable enough in their
way. But it is the subject common to
them all, rather than the intrinsic value
of each picture, which has persuaded
my friend to their collection. One and
all, with the tenderest treatment you can
imagine, they portray a baby feeding at
the gentle breast of its mother. No
other pictures in the room are there but
these, and there must at least be a fair
dozen of them. You cannot fail but
notice them. The similarity of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
subject alone would force itself upon
your mind.</p>

<p>Yet, would you believe it, the ladies
who come there to call upon my friend’s
wife, regard them with horror and
alarm. As their eyes fall upon them,
they turn sharply away, only to be met
with yet another of those improper pictures
upon an opposite wall. With far
greater equanimity and even interest
would they look upon a series of Hogarth’s
prints. The vicar of the parish,
too, was alarmed. He asked my friend
whether he did not think that such pictures
did harm.</p>

<p>“Of course I know,” said he, “it is
a natural function and is all right in its
proper place. I don’t mean to say that
it would do harm to you or to me, of
course—we’re old enough to discriminate.
But younger people are apt to
look at these things in a different light.”</p>

<p>“Do you know that as a fact?” asked
my friend quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, the vicar was a truthful man,
who had read that the devil is the father
of all liars. He held his head thoughtfully
for a moment.</p>

<p>“It is what I imagine would be the
case,” said he. “On which account I
always disapprove of those pictures
which, what you might say, expose the
body of a woman in the so-called interests
of Art. With a man and his wife—if
I may say so—such things are different;
but to make a show of a woman’s
nakedness, that is to me a form of prostitution
at which honestly I shudder
every time it comes my way.”</p>

<p>“I see—I see your point,” said my
friend. “If there is to be prostitution,
let it be that of the wife. I see your
point. But why call marriage a sacrament?
And why solemnise it in a
church? I should have thought the
meat-market had been a better place.”</p>

<p>Great heavens! No wonder the disease
is spreading! No wonder is it that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
women approach the hour of deliverance
in fear and trembling, for neither
do they fit themselves for it, nor are
they proud of the birthright which is
theirs alone. For the sake of appearances,
because they are not well enough
off, because of inconvenience, they will
give up all they possess for the mess
of pottage. Civilisation indeed has
made a strange place of the world.
There are few men and women left in
it now.</p>

<p>Now and again you may run across
a true mother, but all the rest of women
that you meet are only fit to be called
by a name that is indeed too ugly to
write.</p>

<p>A true woman I heard of only the
other day. She was brought to her bed
of childbirth. In the room there was
that still hush, the hush of awe when
out of the “nowhere into here” the
something which is life is about to be
conjured out of the void of nothingness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
which is death. For long, trembling
moments all was still. The faint whispers
and muffled sounds only made the
quietness yet more potent. And then,
suddenly, out of the silence, came the
shrill living, trumpet-cry of a new voice—the
voice of a little child.</p>

<p>The woman stretched her arms and
smiled, as if in that cry she had heard
the voice of God.</p>

<p>“You must lie still,” they whispered
in her ear—“there is yet another child.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” she moaned, and the
silence fell round them once more.</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">XVII
<br />
<small>BELLWATTLE AND THE DIGNITY OF MEN</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">We were all sitting out in the garden
having tea under the nut trees—Bellwattle,
Cruikshank and I. They use the
old Spode tea-service—apple green and
gold and black—whenever tea is taken
out of doors, and I would give anything
to describe to you the pictures that rise
in my mind with the sight of that quaint
old tea-service, the smell of the sweetbriars
and the scent of the stocks. They
are indescribable, those pictures. No
one will ever paint them to my satisfaction,
neither with colours nor with
words. They are composed with such
historical accuracy, are so redolent of
their time, that it would need somebody
with a memory reaching over one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and fifty years to trace them as
they appear to me. Now, if my memory
reaches over five minutes it is doing
well—and many there are the same as
I.</p>

<p>The characters I see are arrayed
in costumes so befitting to their
period, they speak of things so faithful
to their day, that no man, unless
he had lived in the eighteenth century,
could possibly reproduce them. I see
their dainty costumes—I hear their
quaint speech, but not one jot or one
tittle of it all could I put down upon
paper. Yet I know those pictures are
true as true can be.</p>

<p>Why is this? Is there a memory
within us which harks back to lives
we have lived before? Is it by the same
reason we feel that certain incidents
have come to us again out of the far-off
past? I was pondering over it all that
afternoon, when suddenly Bellwattle
broke the silence which surrounded us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why were elephants called elephants?”
she asked.</p>

<p>Cruikshank—of whom, if it cannot
be said that he knows the woman in
his wife, at least knows her queer little
habits—passed his cup without amazement
for more tea. But I—well, it took
my breath away.</p>

<p>“Whatever made you ask that?” I
inquired.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders as
eloquently as she could, being occupied
with Cruikshank’s third cup of
tea.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she replied—“Who
called them elephants, anyhow?”</p>

<p>To this second question, Cruikshank
was as ready as if he were at Sunday
school.</p>

<p>“Adam,” said he. “Adam named
all the beasts and he called them
elephants.”</p>

<p>“But why elephants?” asked Bellwattle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Cruikshank looked at me across the
little garden table. There was an appeal
in his eyes, as though he would
say, “Go on—I’ve answered mine. It’s
your turn now. Don’t let her think we
don’t know.”</p>

<p>For you must understand that, in
their dealings with women, there is a
certain freemasonry amongst men.
If by nature their sex is debarred from
the greatest of all functions, they must
at least steal dignity by the assumption
of great wisdom. No man may ever
admit ignorance to a woman. So long
as her questions have nothing to do with
instinct, he will answer them, whether
or no he tells her the greatest balderdash
you ever heard. All men in
their vows of masonry must swear to
do this. We should be in a sorry way
if women did not look up to us for
knowledge.</p>

<p>When then I received this secret sign
from Cruikshank, I did the best thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
I could for the sex—I answered at a
hazard.</p>

<p>“He called it an elephant,” said I,
“because the impression he received
of its size may have suggested that
word to his mind. He may for example
have been trodden upon by one of those
huge brutes—in which case,” said I,
“the impression would have been a vivid
one.”</p>

<p>“If one of them trod on me, it
wouldn’t suggest the word elephant,”
said Bellwattle. “I should think of
squash.”</p>

<p>“Probably you would,” said Cruikshank;
“but then you’re not Adam.”
By which I think he meant to convey
the mental superiority of his sex.</p>

<p>Therefore—“She might be Eve,”
said I.</p>

<p>Bellwattle closed one eye and looked
at me.</p>

<p>I met her gaze steadily and then, as
suddenly, she put another question to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did Adam name everything?”</p>

<p>“Every single thing,” said Cruikshank.</p>

<p>“All the insects?”</p>

<p>“Every blessed one.”</p>

<p>“Why did he call it Daddy Long Legs,
then?”</p>

<p>Cruikshank seized the opportunity.</p>

<p>“That was what its long legs suggested
to him.”</p>

<p>“But why Daddy?” said Bellwattle
very quickly.</p>

<p>Cruikshank dipped into his third cup
of tea, drowning all possible answer.</p>

<p>“Why Daddy?” she repeated.</p>

<p>“Because,” said I, “Adam was the
father of all living.”</p>

<p>For the moment Cruikshank forgot
his table manners and choked. It took
a great deal of serious assurance on
our part then to convince Bellwattle
that we were in earnest. For we were
in earnest. No man is so serious, or
so put upon his mettle as when a woman
bows to him for knowledge. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
comes that look into his face as well I
remember would creep into the face of
the master when I was at school. No
doubt it is the same now. The vanity
of men does not alter in ten years, or in
ten thousand for that matter.</p>

<p>I can see now the German master—that
is to say the stolid Englishman
who taught us German—I can see him
now reading out a sentence for us to
translate into the language.</p>

<p>“My heart,” read he, most solemnly,
“my heart is in the Highlands—my
heart is not here.”</p>

<p>And there was such pathos, such a
tone of exile in his voice, that I was
prompted to ask him whether, under the
circumstances, he could give his proper
attention to the class.</p>

<p>“Might we not shut up our books,”
said I—“straight away?”</p>

<p>The look that came into his face then
was the look—exaggerated a little perhaps—which
comes into the faces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
most men when the dignity of their
great wisdom is upset. Cruikshank and
I, then, were struggling for our dignity
against the fire of Bellwattle’s questions.
It was no good talking about
the evolution of language to her. She
would never have understood a word of
it. Now, when a man tells a woman
anything which she does not understand,
she is just as likely to think him a
consummate fool. And a man will always
be a fool rather than be thought
one.</p>

<p>We were trying, therefore, to answer
Bellwattle as she would have answered
herself. In other words, we were making
fools of ourselves in order that Bellwattle
should think us wise.</p>

<p>It was here that Cruikshank tempted
providence. Doubtless he thought we
were getting on so well that we could
afford to be generous with our information,
for in quite an uncalled-for way
he volunteered to tell her more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is there anything else,” said he,
“that you want to know?”</p>

<p>She nodded her head and around the
corners of her lips I believe I caught
the suspicion of a smile.</p>

<p>“If Adam called it a cow,” she began——</p>

<p>“He did,” interrupted Cruikshank.
“In those days it probably made that
sort of noise.”</p>

<p>“Then why,” said Bellwattle, giving
him never a moment to retract, “why do
they call it a <em>vache</em> in France?”</p>

<p>We all looked at each other—I at
Cruikshank, Cruikshank at me, and
Bellwattle alternately at both of us.</p>

<p>After a pregnant pause, Cruikshank
began to temporise.</p>

<p>“That’s very like a woman,” said he—“you’re
going into another issue altogether.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said I, “you’re coming to
Bible history.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s Bible history,” repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Cruikshank, “you’re going back to the
Tower of Babel.”</p>

<p>“Is that where they wanted to get
up to Heaven?” she asked.</p>

<p>We nodded our heads emphatically.</p>

<p>“And it all smashed up, and they began
talking like a crowd of tourists?”</p>

<p>“Something like that,” we agreed.</p>

<p>“Then, don’t you see,” went on
Cruikshank, finding his feet once more.
“Then they all separated, went into different
countries, and when they saw a
cow in France they called it <em>vache</em>—it’s
quite simple.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I see that part of it,” said
Bellwattle. You have only to say to a
woman—and moreover be it in the
proper tone of voice—that a thing is
quite simple and she will see it through
and through. I have known Bellwattle
understand a proposition of Euclid by
telling her it was quite simple.</p>

<p>As I say, “If that point is the centre
of this circle, all lines drawn from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
point to the circumference must be
equal; that’s quite simple, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>And she has replied, “Oh—quite—I
see that—but who says it’s the centre?”</p>

<p>If I say Euclid, she then asks me if
I believe everything which people tell
me.</p>

<p>In this manner she saw Cruikshank’s
point about the people in France calling
a cow <em>vache</em>. But after seeing it, she
was silent for a long time. She was
giving it due consideration. I knew that
another question was to come. At last
she looked up.</p>

<p>“But can you explain,” said she,
“how they happened to hit upon the
same animal? I know <em>vache</em> means
cow, but how did the people in France
know that it should be that particular
animal that they were to call <em>vache</em>?
They might have called a pig <em>vache</em>,
and then we should all have been topsy-turvy.”</p>

<p>I ran my fingers through my hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“My God!” said I——</p>

<p>“It’s no good swearing,” said
Bellwattle, “I can see you don’t
know.”</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">XVIII
<br />
<small>THE NIGHT THE POPE DIED</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">It comes back into my mind now, as an
echo that is lost among the hills, that
night in Ardmore in Ireland, that night
when they heard the Pope was dead.
I can hear the low, deep note of the sea,
monotonous and even as the beating of
a heavy drum when the waves rolled
up the boat cove, or leapt upon the rocks
that crouch to meet the sea beneath the
Holy Well. I can see the clouds, great
banks of grey, as though a furnace
were smouldering below the horizon, I
can see them hanging in sullen wet
masses, hanging low over the white
crests that were breaking away by
Helvic Head. I can see the dank, dark
coils of seaweed lying, like the hair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
women that are drowned, along the dim
curved line of the strand. And around
the first head, where the bay spreads
wide into the great Atlantic, the sound
of a rushing wind, muted by the hills,
dimly reaches my ears.</p>

<p>It seems fitting that when any great
catastrophe falls upon the trembling
little people of this world there should
be sounded an ominous note—a discord
struck upon that great orchestra of the
elements. It is the only true accompaniment
to the sorrows of mankind,
when the thunder bursts, the lightning
rends the raiment of the sky and the
winds play wildly on their shrillest instruments.</p>

<p>There was no thunder, no lightning
that night, but all across the bay and
round the headlands you might have
felt the despairing sense of foreboding,
the heavy hour before a storm, when
the very ground seems angry beneath
your feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the night in Ardmore when
they heard the Pope was dead.</p>

<p>In one moment the whole Roman
Catholic world had been robbed of its
father; the great Church of Christ was
without its head on earth. From that
moment and for the anxious days to
come they were as orphans, knowing
not where to turn. The Pope was dead.
But there was none to cry in the
market-place, there was none to stand
upon the chapel steps and shout, “Long
live the Pope!”</p>

<p>The Pope was dead. There was no
Pope.</p>

<p>You must have seen the silent, questioning
faces to have known what
such a loss could mean. Around
the counters in the public-houses the
fishermen sat, afraid to drink. The
women crept into their cottages and
shut the doors. Presently little flickers
of light glowed from each window—candle
flames trembling as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
draughts of wind caught their feeble
glow.</p>

<p>It was as though the spirit of that
old aristocrat, with his death-like head
and piercing eyes, were making its way
to Heaven through the little street of
Ardmore, and these few feeble glimmers
were set out, tiny beacons, to point
his road.</p>

<p>For an hour they were burning before
there came from the village courthouse
the sounds of instruments being
blown, all those weird, unearthly noises
which tell you that a village band is
about to play.</p>

<p>In ten minutes they were ready—the
public-houses were empty. In ten
minutes they were putting their instruments
to their lips; their cheeks were
swelling with the first ready breath to
start. A little crowd of boys and
girls were surrounding them ready to
march by their sides; and then, with
a one—two—three, they began. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
little solemn, serious crowd strode
forth.</p>

<p>Up by the post-office they went, round
by the Protestant Church, along down
Coffee Lane to where stands the seawall
hung with its festoons of red-brown
nets. Then through the main
street they marched and round again
the same route as before.</p>

<p>And ever as they marched, like the
band of an army playing the death
march at the funeral of their chief, they
played the same grim tune—the grimmest
tune at such a time I think I have
ever heard—“Good-bye, Dolly, I must
leave you.” It was the only tune they
knew.</p>

<p>After the second round of their
journey, the playing ceased while the
players gained their breath. In silence
then, they tramped over the same
ground, the little crowd, eager for the
music again, still following at their
heels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>When they reached the top of Coffee
Lane once more, where the road runs
up to meet the Holy Well and wanders
from there in a thin straggling path
around the wild cliff-heads, there came
an elderly woman and a child out of the
darkness.</p>

<p>Seven miles they had walked around
that dangerous path from the little
fishing hamlet of Whiting Bay—seven
miles over a way where a goat must
choose its steps, where at moments the
sheer cliff rushes down four hundred
feet to meet the sea—seven miles in
that chill darkness with never a lantern’s
light to guide their feet—seven
miles with hearts throbbing, hope rising
and falling, whispering a word to each
other now and then, always straining
on—seven miles just to learn the truth.</p>

<p>As they came out of the shadows, the
woman stopped. The clarionet-player
was wetting his lips, fitting his fingers
with infinite care upon the notes of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
instrument. She caught his arm before
he could raise it to his mouth.</p>

<p>“What is ut?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Shure, the Pope’s dead,” he whispered
back.</p>

<p>And then, with its one—two—three
once more, the band struck up again.
The woman and the child stood there
silently under a cottage window, the
light of the burning candle within making
pin-points in their eyes, while in
their ears echoed and re-echoed the
words, “The Pope is dead,” mingling
with the refrain, “Good-bye, Dolly, I
must leave you.”</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">XIX
<br />
<small>ART</small></p>


<p>It was explained to me the other
day, the meaning of this elusive little
word of three letters. All my pre-conceived
opinions were dashed to the
ground and, in the space of half an
hour, I was taught the modern appreciation
of the meaning of that word—Art.</p>

<p>It chanced I wanted a copy of that
picture by Furze, “Diana of the Uplands”—Furze
whom the gods loved
or envied, I don’t know which. I
wanted a copy of it to hang in my bedroom
in a little farmhouse in the
country. I wanted to hang it near my
bed so that when I woke of a morning,
I could start straight away across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Uplands, feeling the generous give of
the heather beneath my feet, tasting the
freshening draught of wind in my
nostrils, taking into my limbs the energy
of those hounds ever ready to strain
away from their leash and leave
their mistress a speck upon a dim
horizon.</p>

<p>It chanced that I wanted all that—which
is not a little. But these are the
real good things of life which are so
seldom bought because they are so
cheap. A small print-seller’s in Regent
Street was good enough for me.</p>

<p>I walked in. On the threshold I was
met by a little serving-maid with a
chubby red face and a brand-new green
apron.</p>

<p>“Yes?” said she.</p>

<p>It opened the conversation excellently.</p>

<p>“I want a coloured print of ‘Diana
of the Uplands,’” said I.</p>

<p>She hurried to a portfolio and began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
turning over coloured prints at an incredible
speed. Before she had found
it, she looked up.</p>

<p>“Will you have it plain?” she asked,
“or with a B.A.M.?”</p>

<p>“A B.A.M.?” said I. I could not
describe to you the effect of those three
mysterious letters. It sounded almost
improper. “You ought not to say
things like that to me,” I continued
solemnly. “Supposing I said that you
were a V.P.G.”</p>

<p>She became at a loss between confusion
and amusement.</p>

<p>“I forgot,” she said, apologetically.
“I’m new here, and that’s what we call
them. It means British Art Mount.”</p>

<p>At that moment there came another
serving-maid in a green apron.</p>

<p>“What is it you want, sir?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m being attended to, thank
you,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Yes, but this young lady’s new to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the shop,” she said; “she’s not quite
used to serving yet.”</p>

<p>“She’s doing very well indeed,” said
I. “She’s already nearly persuaded me
to buy a thing I don’t want—a thing I
don’t even know the meaning of.”</p>

<p>The little girl with the chubby cheeks
wriggled her shoulders with delight.</p>

<p>“I asked him if he wanted a B.A.M.,”
she explained.</p>

<p>The other looked quite shocked.</p>

<p>“You know I’ve told you not to say
that,” she said. “You’d better go up
to Miss Nelson, she wants you upstairs.”</p>

<p>The little maid departed. I was left
with her more elderly and more experienced
sister in trade. In a moment
she had discovered the picture in question
and had laid it out for my approval.
I did approve; and then she asked me
if I wanted it framed.</p>

<p>“If you do framing here, I shall be
very glad,” said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then what sort of frame would you
like?” she asked.</p>

<p>I hesitated. I was trying to see it
in my mind’s eye on that bedroom wall;
see it when the sun was pouring in
through the open window; when the
rain was pattering against the panes,
and the sky was grey. Therefore, while
I made up my mind—just, perhaps, to
conceal from her the fact that I could
be in doubt about such a matter—I
asked her what she would suggest.</p>

<p>She drew herself up, conscious of the
state of importance which she had attained
with my question.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, and her head hung
thoughtfully on one side—“that depends
on what room it’s for. Is it for
the dining-room or the drawing-room?”</p>

<p>Now what possessed me, I do not
know; but when I thought of that little
farmhouse in the valley between the
Uplands, the words dining-room and
drawing-room sounded ridiculous. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
is just a sitting-room—and a small sitting-room—that
is all. This dining-room
and drawing-room seemed nonsensical,
and what with one thing and
another it put me in a nonsensical mood.</p>

<p>“’Tis for the cook’s bedroom,” said
I.</p>

<p>If only you had seen her face! It
fell like a stone over a cliff and, what
is more, it never seemed to reach the
bottom of that expression of bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she replied—“I see. Well,
then, I’m sure I couldn’t advise you.
Tastes differ—don’t they?”</p>

<p>“So I’ve heard,” said I. “But I wish
you would advise me, all the same. I’m
quite ignorant about these things. I’m
only a farmer. I’ve just come up to
London for the day and I’ve been given
this commission for—well, she’s more
than the cook—she’s the housekeeper.
She didn’t tell me anything about the
frame. What frame would you suggest?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
I thought a nice rosewood one;
but you know much better about these
sort of things than I do.”</p>

<p>“A rosewood one won’t be bad,” said
she, in a quaint little tone of voice that
gently patronised me. “A rosewood
one’ll do,” she repeated; “but it’s not
Art.”</p>

<p>That phrase had an electrical sound
to me; and when I say electrical, I mean,
beside the shock of it, something which
neither you nor I nor any of us understand.</p>

<p>“Why isn’t it Art?” I asked quickly.
“You mustn’t think me foolish,” I added,
“but really I suppose I’m what you call
a country bumpkin; I know nothing
about these things. Why isn’t it Art?”</p>

<p>“Just——it isn’t,” she replied, and
she took down a sample of black moulding
and a sample of gold; then she laid
a sample of rosewood on one side of
the picture. “There,” she said, “that’s
your cook’s taste.” She did not quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
like to call it mine. Then she laid the
other two samples on the other sides
of the print—“and that’s Art.”</p>

<p>I looked at the picture, then I looked
at her. Then I looked back at the picture
again.</p>

<p>“But how do you know it’s Art?”
said I.</p>

<p>She pulled herself up still straighter
and she answered, with all the confidence
in the world—</p>

<p>“Because I’ve been taught—that’s
why. Because I’ve been educated to it.
I haven’t spent five years here amongst
all these pictures without learning
what’s Art and what isn’t.”</p>

<p>“And now you know?” said I.</p>

<p>She nodded her head heavily with
wisdom.</p>

<p>“But are you sure you’ve been taught
right?” I went on. “How are you to
know that the people who taught you
knew?”</p>

<p>“’Cos they’ve been in the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
all their lives,” she replied. “’Cos
they’ve found out what the public like
and they give it to them. It’s like one
person learning music on a grand piano
and another learning music on a cheap
cottage piano. Do you mean to tell me
that the one as learns on the grand
piano isn’t going to be a better musician
than the one as learns on the cottage?”</p>

<p>“It’s more likely that they’d be a better
judge of pianos,” said I.</p>

<p>She told me I was talking silly and
which frame would I have.</p>

<p>“I’m trying not to talk silly,” I assured
her. “I mean every word I say, only I
haven’t been educated as you have. You
must remember that, and make allowances.
I only said that about the piano
because I knew a lady who had a satinwood
Blüthner grand piano, and she
never played on it from one day to
another, so that she did not even know
what a good piano was, and much less
did she know about music.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish she’d give it to me,” said the
little serving-maid.</p>

<p>“I wish she would,” said I; “then
perhaps you’d admit that there was
something in what I said, after all. But,
joking aside, if you’ve been taught what
is Art and what isn’t, couldn’t you teach
me? I love the country. I think the
fields of corn that grow up on my land
every year are beautiful. And when I
see them getting ripe and being
gathered, then going out to feed the
whole world—you here in the cities,
who don’t know the gold of a ripening
field of corn—every single one of you,
all fed from those wonderful fields that
have waves like the sea when the winds
blow across them—things like that I
know about—things like that I appreciate.”</p>

<p>“Oh—well—that’s Nature,” said she.
“We were talking about Art. Art’s
holdin’ the mirror up to Nature—see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then what’s the matter with the
mirror?” I asked.</p>

<p>“What mirror?”</p>

<p>“The mirror of Art?”</p>

<p>“Why there’s nothing the matter with
it.”</p>

<p>“Well—I don’t know,” said I, “but it
seems to me as if so many people have
been taught to look into it, that it has
become dulled with their breath and
won’t reflect anything now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” she
said.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I know myself,” I
replied. “I haven’t been taught like you
have.”</p>

<p>“Well—which frame would you
like?” she asked a little testily.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid my housekeeper’ll be
annoyed if I don’t take the rosewood
one,” said I.</p>

<br />
<small>THE VALUE OF IDLENESS</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">“If you want to be quiet,” said my
friend, “you had better go and sit up in
the old mill.”</p>

<p>I acquiesced at once.</p>

<p>“Just give me a table and a chair,”
said I. “I shall be quite comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to write?” he asked.</p>

<p>I nodded my head.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“An essay.”</p>

<p>“On what?”</p>

<p>“The Value of Idleness.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do that well,” said he, and he
told the gardener to take up to the mill
all that I required.</p>

<p>So here am I, writing the Value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Idleness in the little oak-beamed loft
of an old mill.</p>

<p>To do nothing is to be receptive of
everything. Idleness of the body alone
will serve you not at all. It is only when
the mind—but to follow the mood, to
understand the drift of this philosophy
of idleness, you must see, as I see it, this
old white mill in which I sit and
write.</p>

<p>Last night, as we walked out in the
garden, the moon was in her chariot,
whirling in a mad race through the
heavens. In and out of a thousand
clouds she rode recklessly.</p>

<p>She carries news, thought I, and
were she the daughter of Nimshi, she
could not drive more furiously.</p>

<p>And there, under her shifting light,
with great arms raised appealingly into
the wind, stood the old wind-mill, just
at the end of the little red-brick path
which runs through an avenue of
gnarled apple trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>I touched my friend’s arm and
pointed.</p>

<p>“She’s very beautiful,” said I.</p>

<p>“She’s very old,” said he.</p>

<p>Then I suddenly saw in her the figure
of a patient woman, who has given up
her youth, appealing with passionate
arms to God to grant her rest. Another
moment and there came a faint moaning
sigh falling upon my ears—a sigh
like the fluttering of an autumn leaf
that eddies slowly to the ground.</p>

<p>“What is that?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The wind-mill,” said my friend.
“She’s crying to be set free, to have
her arms unloosed.”</p>

<p>As he said that, I saw her as a tired
woman no longer. She became majestic
in her agony then. So it seemed to me
must the women in Siberia cry at night
with faces turned, and hands stretched
forth towards their native Russia.</p>

<p>“How long has she been idle?” I inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh—many, many years,” said he.</p>

<p>It was this which made me think of
writing the Value of Idleness. So here
am I, writing my essay on Idleness in
the little oak-beamed loft of an old mill.</p>

<p>You cannot think how silent it is. I
feel away and above the world. From
the wee square window between the
beams I can see the miller’s cottage with
its broad sloping roof of old red tiles,
leaning down until it nearly touches
the ground. But beyond that, on one
side, stretches the whole weald of Kent
and, on the other, lie the Romney
marshes spreading forth to meet the
sea. And there is the sea—that faint,
far margin of blue—a chaplet upon the
smooth, broad forehead of the world.</p>

<p>Yet silent and still as it all is, I can
nevertheless hear voices. Upon the
great oak shaft, the tireless vertebra
of this goddess of the wind, there are
two initials carved by some patient
hand. L.B. are the letters cut, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
following them comes the date—1790.
There is a voice to be heard from that,
if you do but listen well. I can see
one of those young millers who, when
never a leaf was rustling on the trees
and the air was still in a breathless
calm, I can see him sitting there in a
moment of idleness, carving out his
initials and the date in deep, bold
characters. Then saying aloud to himself,
“Maybe there’ll be some as’ll
read that in a hundred years, and wonder
who be I.”</p>

<p>I can hear the incisions of his knife
as he cut into the stern hard oak, the
little silences, the little grunts of his
breath as he laboured over each letter.
No—for all its stillness, there are
voices in this old mill. Up the oak
ladder that leads through the ceiling
to another floor I can just see the great
heavy wheel that turned the shaft. It
is grey even now with the dust of flour
and, as its sharp teeth gleam down at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
me out of the darkness, the echoes of
those rumbling sounds when the wind
was high and the sails were racing
round, comes faintly to my ears like
thunder afar off.</p>

<p>So here am I, in the midst of these
silent voices of the mill—here am I,
writing an essay on the Value of Idleness.</p>

<p>“Idleness of the body,” I had begun,
“will serve you not at all. It is only
when the mind is yielding to the drug
of laziness as well, that your ears are
attuned to the silent voices and you
can speak——”</p>

<p>What was that?</p>

<p>A sudden clatter, a beating of sudden
wings around my head!</p>

<p>Only a bat. I watch it as it circles
round the old loft. The evening is beginning
to fall; I see the cows being
driven home along the road. A soft
greyness is wrapping its fine web about
the world and this little creature is venturing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
forth from its hiding-place before
the day is yet quite dead.</p>

<p>What a wonderful house to live in—this
old, old mill! I scarcely wonder
at the beauty and simplicity of the
“Lettres de mon Moulin” as I sit here
with the upper half of the creaking door
wide open, and the far hills stretching
out to sleep as the night draws round
about them.</p>

<p>But now, as the grey light grows
deeper and twilight hangs upon a frail
thread ere it drops into the lap of darkness;
now, as though it were a herald of
the night to come, a wind springs up
across the land. I hear it as its first
whispers begin to tell their secrets in
the corners and the crevices. Yet it
whispers not for long. Soon, with a
loud, insistent voice, it is crying its importunate
passion to the mill. But she
is chained. The fetters cling unmercifully
to her arms. She cannot move.
Again and again the wind envelops her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
in its embrace, but she makes no answer
to its passion. Only now and again
there comes her faint, despairing cry—the
cry of a woman in pain—the cry of
a woman in prison. I feel so sorely
tempted to set her free, just to see her
great generous arms sweeping in a joyous
abandonment of life before the
wind she loves so well.</p>

<p>And here am I, in this old, old silent
mill, writing an essay on the Value of
Idleness.</p>

<p>Night is on the verge now. The
words run into one another upon the
paper. It is so dark that my pen
wanders from the faint ruled line and
sets out on its own account across the
dim grey page.</p>

<p>At last comes the voice of my friend
far below.</p>

<p>“Have you finished your idleness
yet?”</p>

<p>“It’s finished,” say I with a sense of
loss of the moments that have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
mine—mine and this dear, sad woman’s
in prison. I bolt the doors and come
down.</p>

<p>“Come and read it to me now,” says
he.</p>

<p>And I read it all.</p>

<p class="asterism">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“But there’s nothing about idleness,”
he said. “Where’s the Value of Idleness?”</p>

<p>“Here,” said I, and I threw the
papers across to him. “It’s all Idleness.
To do nothing is to be receptive of
everything. I’ve been doing nothing.”</p>

<p  class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">XXI
<br />
<small>THE SPIRIT OF COMPETITION</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">Not a few are there to applaud this
spirit of competition, this modern endeavour
to do things well, not because
they are worth doing, but from the
desire to do them better than other
people.</p>

<p>Yet it is a canker that eats its way
into the heart of everything. Bellwattle,
in her happiest mood of distinction,
would call it one of the laws
of God. But whether it be a law of
God or of Nature; whether, in fact, it
be a law at all and not simply one of
these fungoid growths of civilisation,
it is a deceptive matter whichever way
you look at it.</p>

<p>You would imagine, whether you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
were Jesuit or not, that the end would
justify the means in such a question
as this. You might believe that, so long
as the thing were done well, it would
matter little, if at all, the motive which
prompted its well-doing. Yet this is
just where the subtle poison of it lurks.
For it is not of necessity doing a thing
well, to do it better than any one else.
The moment you begin to work like
this, you create a false standard, lowering
the value of everything you do. It
is not the spirit of charity to give more
than your next door neighbour. That
is the spirit of competition. The spirit
of charity it is to give the last penny
you can spare. The widow’s mite is
charity. The millionaire’s thousand is
bombast.</p>

<p>But this confusion of terms—this
confusion of motives is so growing into
the language we speak that words,
which once were so priceless, are become
like weapons worn out and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
blunted. There is but little edge left
to any words now. They will cut nothing.</p>

<p>And so this spirit of competition is
a fetish to-day. We do not speak of
having done a thing as well as we can
do it, but of having done it better than
this man or that.</p>

<p>“I bet you,” says the actor, “I could
play that part better than the man who
plays it now.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me,” says the
politician, “that the speech I made last
Friday wasn’t as good as Disraeli at
his best?”</p>

<p>“That last book of mine,” says the
writer, “was nearly as good as ‘The
Old Curiosity Shop.’ I think myself
that the death-scene was better in a
way.”</p>

<p>Ah! but if we only did say these
things aloud, instead of thinking them
in silence. For ’tis only in silence now—as
they would understand it in Ireland—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
we say what we really
mean.</p>

<p>So is it that there creeps this spirit
of working by comparison into the soul
and tissue of everything we do. Yet
you would think, would you not, that
the Church had kept herself free of it?
But the Church is more eaten away with
the spirit of competition than is many
a humble labourer, driven to earn his
living wage by making his work better
than the rest.</p>

<p>Take this story for what it is worth;
apply it as you will. It has only one
meaning for me.</p>

<p>In Ireland, they call the wandering
beggars, who live an itinerant existence,
living from one town to another—they
call them tinkers. A certain
tinker woman, then, came into the
city of Cork. Down one of the
quays, seeking the scraps that fall in
these places, dragging three wretched
children at the frayed hem of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
skirt, she was seen by a Protestant
vicar.</p>

<p>Shifting one bare foot behind the
other, she bobbed him a curtesy.</p>

<p>“For the love an’ honour av God,
yeer riv’rance, give a poor ’ooman a
copper, that the Almighty blessin’s av
God may discind on ye, yeer riv’rance.
Oh, sure, God Almighty give ye
grace.”</p>

<p>The Vicar stopped.</p>

<p>“Where do you come from?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I’m after walkin’ all the ways from
Macroon, yeer riv’rance—an’ I in me
feet.”</p>

<p>She held up a bare blistered foot, at
the sight of which the Vicar shudderingly
closed his eyes.</p>

<p>“Where’s your husband?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Me husband, yeer riv’rance? Shure,
glory be, I haven’t had a sight or a
sound av him these two years. ’Twas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the day Ginnet’s circus was in Dingarvin,
an’ he along wid ’em clanin’ the
horses, and faith that was the last I
saw av him, good or bad. I’m
thinkin’ he’s gone foreign—he has indeed.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go to a priest? He’s
the person to help you—not me. I’m
a Protestant clergyman.”</p>

<p>“Shure, I know that yeer riv’rance—an’
why would I be goin’ to a preyst,
an’ I wid me three little children here—the
poor darlin’s—they’ve had divil a
bit to eat this whole day.”</p>

<p>The competitive instincts of the Vicar
cried aloud with a resonant voice in his
ear.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say they haven’t
been brought up in the Roman Catholic
Church?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>“They have not indeed. Shure, what
good would that be doin’ them?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t they been baptised at all
into any Church?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“They have not.”</p>

<p>The Vicar felt in his pocket and produced
a sixpence.</p>

<p>“Get them something to eat,” said he,
“and then come and see me. I shudder
when I think they haven’t been baptised.
Have you?”</p>

<p>“I was when I was a child,” said she,
“but I haven’t been to Mass these fifteen
years. Glory be to God, what’ud I be
doin’ at Mass when I might be gettin’
charity from a grand gintleman like
yeerself?”</p>

<p>“My poor woman,” said the Vicar,
“it was Christ’s wish that we should
help the poor. I’m thinking, too, of
the hereafter of those poor little children
of yours. What hope of salvation
do you think there is for them if they
have never been baptised?”</p>

<p>“If ’tis as difficult in this world as
it is to get a bite or a sup, ’tis a hard
thing indeed. But what good would I
be getting to baptise ’em?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you let them come to my church
and be baptised, I’ll see that you won’t
be forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Will yeer riv’rance give me something
the way I cud be goin’ on with?”</p>

<p>“I will, of course.”</p>

<p>“An’ how much?”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you five shillings, my poor
woman. You can get a week’s lodging
and food with that.”</p>

<p>“Oh—shure I’d want five shillings
for each wan of them,” she replied
quickly.</p>

<p>The Vicar paused. The tone of this
bargaining jarred upon his ears; but
yet, as he thought of it—three little
souls saved—three little souls caught
from the grasp of the Roman Church—three
more names upon his baptismal
register. And only fifteen shillings! It
was money nobly spent, honourably set
aside for the great interest and reward
hereafter.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you fifteen shillings,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
he, “if you bring them to the church to-morrow
morning to be baptised.”</p>

<p>She clasped her hands in ecstasy.</p>

<p>“May the Almighty God give ye the
blessings of his Holy Name, and may
all the saints be wid ye in the hour of
need. Faith, I niver met a finer Christian
or a grander gintleman in all me
life.”</p>

<p>She caught her children round her
and told them the great things that
were in store for them. With a warm
feeling that the day had not passed in
vain, the Vicar hurried away.</p>

<p>Directly he was out of sight, the
woman made her way to the presbytery
of the first Roman Catholic church she
could find.</p>

<p>“I want to see the preyst,” said she,
when they opened the door to her knocking.</p>

<p>They looked at her ragged clothes.
It was with difficulty that she gained
an audience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go round into the chapel,” they said,
“and Father —— will be with you in
a minute.”</p>

<p>She plunged quickly into her story
directly he came.</p>

<p>“Indeed, he was a nice gintleman,”
she concluded, “and ’twas fifteen shillings
he offered me if I’d bring the three
of them to the church to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>She gazed down at them and they
gazed up at her. In some vague way
they realised that they were under discussion.
Their little mouths were open
in wonder.</p>

<p>“’Tis a disgraceful thing, indeed!”
said the priest in wrath, “to think ye’d
go and sell the souls of yeer own children
to one of those Protestant fellas
who’d only be too glad the way they
could be counting three more names in
their Church. I’m ashamed of ye—I
am indeed! If I give ye twelve shillings
now, will ye bring them here to me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh—glory be to God, Father—shure
that’s only four shillings for each
wan of the pore t’ings. I thought ’twas
the way ye’d have offered me a poond
at least to save the pore creatures the
way they wouldn’t be havin’ their souls
damned.”</p>

<p>“Yeer a disgraceful woman,” said he,
“to barter the souls of yeer children like
that. I’ll give ye seventeen shillings,
and I won’t give ye a penny more.”</p>

<p>She clasped her hands again and the
tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“The blessing av God and av the
Blessed Mother be wid ye,” she cried.
“Ye’ve saved the souls of three pore
creatures this blessed day.”</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">XXII
<br />
<small>BELLWATTLE ON THE HIGHER
MATHEMATICS</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">I have already been at some pains in a
few of these pages to give an idea of
the feminine appreciation of mathematics.
Undoubtedly it is more practical
than that of many an eminent
mathematician. For let it at once be
understood that the first function of a
higher mathematician is to express himself
in terms of mathematics, just as an
artist expresses himself in the colours
he lays upon his canvas, or a musician
by the little black and white dots he
writes between and through the lines.</p>

<p>“Nobody”—so a scientist once said
to me—“nobody seems to understand
this. They have never learnt the language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
we talk in and they fancy that we
only fit our place in the universe so
long as we are useful. If I were to talk
to you now of the things I am doing in
my laboratory, using the terms and the
technicalities that I use there, you’d
probably think I was endeavouring to
be scientifically brilliant in my conversation,
stringing together all the most
exaggerated words to get an effect
which you could not understand;
whereas, in reality, I should be talking
the most ordinary commonplaces which
even the boy who cleans out the vessels
and the flasks can probably understand.
Let a man invent a talking machine, or
a calculating machine, and they call him
a great scientist. Good heavens! If
you knew how the real scientists and
the real mathematicians despise him.
Why, I’ve seen a mathematician express
the soul in himself so absolutely
by the solution of an abstruse problem,
that he has cried with joy like a child—like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
an artist when he has finished his
masterpiece, a writer when he has ended
his book.”</p>

<p>“May I never burst into tears, if ever
I write a book,” said I.</p>

<p>“Well—you know what I mean,” said
he.</p>

<p>And I suppose I did know. Utility
is the prostitution of most things as
well as science and mathematics. But
that is just where women are more
practical mathematicians than men. I
have never known a woman set out to
express herself in mathematics yet.
What is more, I pray God, most fervently,
I never shall. She will employ
the wildest means of expression in the
world, but nothing so wild or incoherent
as mathematics.</p>

<p>I try to conceive a woman in a fit
of jealousy sitting down to express her
emotions through the medium of the
binomial theorem—which I must tell
you I know to be a method of expanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
X and Y, bracketed to the Nth
power, to an infinite series of powers—I
try to conceive her doing that, but my
conception always fails. Far more
readily can I see her inviting to tea the
creature who is the cause of her jealousy,
and evincing the sweetest friendship
for her. Now that is expression,
if you like, bracketed, moreover, without
any necessity for your binomial
theorem, to the Nth power, and expanded
to an infinite expression of femininity.</p>

<p>To give you just the simplest example
of this matter of the practicality
of women in mathematics, I must tell
you that Cruikshank and I the other
evening were recalling our prowess at
Euclid; setting each other problems to
prove—well, you know the routine of
the propositions of Euclid.</p>

<p>In the midst of darning some socks
and, having listened to us in silence for
at least an hour, Bellwattle looked up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“Was Euclid mad?” she asked, quite
seriously.</p>

<p>There was something in the nature
of a ricochet in that question. It touched
not only Euclid, for whom we have infinite
respect, but also ourselves, for
whom we have more.</p>

<p>“The sanest person that ever lived,”
said Cruikshank, shortly.</p>

<p>“Then why did he waste his time inventing
all that rubbish? What’s the
good of it, anyhow?”</p>

<p>I put away my pencil with which from
memory I had just been drawing the
diagram for the fourth proposition of
the second book.</p>

<p>“It develops,” I answered, “the reasoning
power in the human animal—a
not unworthy or wholly unnecessary
purpose.”</p>

<p>She darned a few stitches in silence.</p>

<p>“Has it ever done any good besides
that?” she inquired presently.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Cruikshank, “it teaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
you, for example, how, without measuring
and purely by the light of reason, to
construct an equilateral triangle on a
given finite straight line.”</p>

<p>Bellwattle laid down her sock with
the knob of wood inside it and she
looked at both of us as though we were
creatures from another world.</p>

<p>“And what in the name of goodness,”
said she, “is an equi—whatever-you-call-it
triangle?”</p>

<p>Cruikshank went on with his explanation
quite cheerily. On this proposition
he was so sure of himself that
confidence was actually glowing in his
face.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “you know what a
triangle is, don’t you?”</p>

<p>She nodded her head promisingly.</p>

<p>“One of those things they sometimes
play in bands.”</p>

<p>The look of confidence dropped heavily
from Cruikshank’s face; but I seized
the opportunity. She understood. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
least she had grasped the shape of it.
It mattered not at all that in her mind
its functions were to play a tune. She
appreciated the shape of it. That served
its end.</p>

<p>“You’re quite right,” said I quickly.
“They have it in an orchestra. It has
three sides to it—hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>She nodded her head vivaciously.</p>

<p>“Yes, and two little curly bits at the
top where they tie the string on to hang
it up by.”</p>

<p>“My God!” said Cruikshank in despair.</p>

<p>But I acceded her the little curly bits.
She had grasped the shape of a triangle.</p>

<p>“Well, try and forget the curly bits,”
said I. “They have three sides—haven’t
they?”</p>

<p>She acquiesced.</p>

<p>“Like this,” I went on hurriedly, and,
dragging out my pencil again, I drew
a triangle on a piece of paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s it,” said she; “but they don’t
meet at the top.”</p>

<p>“Some do,” I replied; “the ones that
Euclid made did.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on,” she said, with greater
interest. “What’s an equitriangle?”</p>

<p>“An equilateral triangle,” said Cruikshank,
now stepping in when I had done
all the hard work for him, “is a triangle
which has all its sides of equal
length. That side,”—he pointed to my
drawing—“that side and that side all
equal. Now Euclid’ll show you,” he
continued, “how to construct an equilateral
triangle on a given finite straight
line. You needn’t measure anything.
You only want a compass to make a
couple of circles, and he’ll prove to your
reason that all the lines of that triangle
are one and the same length as this line
you see on the paper now.”</p>

<p>He turned to me.</p>

<p>“Lend me a ha’penny,” said he.</p>

<p>I gave him the only one I had and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
he set to work to draw the most beautiful
circles, though they had but little
relation to A as their centre and B as
their circumference, which were the
letters he had written at each end of his
given finite straight line.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, that’ll do,” said he.</p>

<p>And then, forthwith, he began to
prove it to her.</p>

<p>I went out to get myself a cigar in
the dining-room, and while there, cutting
off the end of it and smiling gently
to myself as I did so, I heard the voice
of Cruikshank raised in the passion of
despair.</p>

<p>“My God! my dear child,” I heard
him say. “I proved those two were
equal because they both came from the
centre of this circle—B.F.G. to the circumference.
You don’t remember anything.”</p>

<p>I lit my cigar with a trembling hand.
Then I walked to the window of the
dining-room and looked out into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
garden. There were the tom-tits pecking
away at the cocoa-nut shell which
Bellwattle had hung up with such infinite
trouble; there were the kittens,
lapping from a saucer of milk as Bellwattle
and their mother had taught
them; there were the sweet peas in great
walls of colour with the old pieces of
red flannel still clinging to the pea-sticks,
those same pieces of flannel
which Bellwattle had tied to keep off the
birds when the shoots were young and
green; there was the little robin which
Bellwattle fed every afternoon at tea-time;
there, in fact, were all the signs
of Bellwattle’s beautiful and wonderful
and practical utility.</p>

<p>I came back into the other room at
the sound of Cruikshank’s voice as he
called me.</p>

<p>“She sees it!” he exclaimed in an
ecstasy. “She understands it all right.
I made it clear, didn’t I, Bellwattle?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite,” said she. “I understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
it now right enough. But I never knew
Euclid made instruments for bands.”</p>

<p>Cruikshank tore up his piece of paper
and flung it in the grate.</p>

<p>So you see, if she really knew, I’ve
no doubt she’d return to question
Euclid’s sanity once more. I feel inclined
to question it myself, but then
that is because I know he did not make
instruments for bands. He only expressed
himself—that was all.</p>

<br />
<small>THE MYSTERY OF THE VOTE</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">I never knew how really splendid a possession
was this of the vote until the
last election. It is no wonder to me
now that women throw dignity to the
four winds of heaven, leaving it to
chance and the grace of God whether
it ever blows back to them again. It
is no wonder to me that, for the moment,
they can forget their glorious
heritage in order to obtain this mysterious
joy of recording their vote on
a little slip of paper in the secrecy of
the ballot-box.</p>

<p>As a mystery—and all mysteries are
power—it had never appealed to me.
As a means of urging the laws of the
country in such direction as one was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
pleased to consider for that country’s
good, it did once seem to me to be invaluable.
I know by now what a hopeless
fallacy that is. But at that time,
nursing a political conviction that Home
Rule would be good for Ireland as a
people, much as I am led to believe food
is good to a starving man, or a sense of
religion to a drifting woman, I listened
to the eloquent appeal of a canvasser for
a Unionist candidate.</p>

<p>When he had finished telling me
much more than either of us knew about
Tariff Reform, and had built such a
Navy before my eyes as would have
frightened the whole German Government
and any single English ratepayer
out of their wits, I asked him what the
Unionist candidate felt about Home
Rule.</p>

<p>“Home Rule?” said he, carefully—“You
approve of Home Rule?”</p>

<p>I walked gently and easily into the
canvasser’s trap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“You don’t denationalise a country,”
said I, “because you conquer it. You
can’t cut the soul out of Ireland any
more than you can wash a nigger
white. You can only boycott it. You
can only paint a nigger. But boycotting
won’t starve the soul of any nation. If
it can’t get food for itself from the
nation’s stores, it will still live, feeding
from the country-side on the wild
herb of endurance. But there is
that which you can do. You <em>can</em> boycott
it.”</p>

<p>“And you think that Home Rule will
encourage the development of the Irish
people?” said he.</p>

<p>I admitted that the idea had occurred
to me.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. —— is quite of your way
of thinking,” he replied.</p>

<p>“He would support it with his vote in
the House?” said I.</p>

<p>“Most assuredly!” he declared.</p>

<p>“I shall vote for Mr. ——,” said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>And so I should, had I not gone to
one of his meetings in the Town Hall.
He, too, spoke eloquently about Tariff
Reform and a Navy that would keep
our country what it was; but in the
midst of it, a cockney voice endeavoured
to heckle him from the back of the hall.</p>

<p>“’Ow about ’Ome Rule?” shouted
the voice.</p>

<p>The Unionist candidate had been
heckled before.</p>

<p>“How about it?” he asked sharply,
like the crack of a pistol.</p>

<p>“Are you going to let the Roman
Catholics get the ’old in Ireland?”</p>

<p>“And make them a menace to England,
too—do you think it’s likely?” replied
the candidate.</p>

<p>I walked away. “The vote,” said I
to myself, “the vote is only a catchpenny
title for a popular game. It would be
much better to gamble than vote. You
might get something for your money
if you backed the right man with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
shilling; but you get nothing for backing
him with your vote. In future,”
said I, “I shall bet.”</p>

<p>Yet only a little while afterwards I
was to learn what a glorious thing the
vote is.</p>

<p>In my village there is an amiable
labourer with that cast of countenance
upon which, as on the possessions of his
great country, the sun never sets. And
with it all, he has that placidity of manner,
that evenness of gait which suggest
that he is always going to or coming
from a service at his chapel.</p>

<p>No one would ever dream of consulting
him upon anything, though, indeed,
I once did ask him the name of a certain
plant.</p>

<p>“There be some as call it the Deadly
shade,” said he, “and some as call it the
Nightly shade, but I don’t know rightly
which it be.”</p>

<p>When later on, for my own foolish
amusement, I said I had heard it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
called the Deadly shade, he replied in
precisely the same fashion. I tried him
once more, by saying that I had looked
up a book on the subject and found it
to be the Nightly shade. Again he replied,
word for word, as before.</p>

<p>At last, a few weeks later, I came to
him and said—</p>

<p>“You know we were all wrong about
that plant. I find at South Kensington
Museum that the proper name for it is
the Deadly Nightshade.”</p>

<p>And what do you think he replied?
“There be some,” said he, “as call it
the Deadly shade, and some as call it
the Nightly shade, but I don’t know
rightly which it be.”</p>

<p>Now that man’s wife had no respect
for him, and truly I’m not surprised. I
found out, too, that he knew it—it would
not, of course, be a difficult fact to ascertain—and
I felt sorry for him.</p>

<p>And then one day—the day before the
polling in our village—all my pity for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
him was ended. I met him on the road,
carrying home his bag of tools.</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “are you going to vote
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>His face broadened with a beaming
smile.</p>

<p>“I am that,” said he.</p>

<p>“Who are you going to vote for?” I
asked.</p>

<p>A cunning look crept into his little
twinkling eyes, and he said—</p>

<p>“Ah—that’s telling.”</p>

<p>I admitted that there was that to it
and asked him to tell me.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“I keeps that to myself,” said he.
“We’re not supposed to tell who we
vote for. All they votes is counted
secret.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you don’t tell
anybody?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied—“I don’t tell none.”</p>

<p>“But you tell your wife,” said I.</p>

<p>He shook his head again, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
smile was broader and his eyes more
cunning than ever.</p>

<p>“Surely she wants to know,” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Ah—she may want to know, but that
ain’t my tellin’ her—is it?”</p>

<p>Then I suddenly realised what a glorious
weapon he possessed. A weapon
which, when everything else—even intelligence—failed,
would make him
master in his own house.</p>

<p>“That must give you a splendid sense
of importance in your own home,” said
I—“Don’t they think you’re a fine fellow?”</p>

<p>“P’raps they do.”</p>

<p>“And all because you’ve got the mystery
of a vote.”</p>

<p>“I can’t think of no other reason,”
said he.</p>

<p>So whenever the question of giving
women the vote is raised, I can think,
too, of no other reason for their wanting
it. A woman will bow her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
before a mystery when all sense of worship
has left her. It is this which gives
her so much respect for the priesthood;
it is this perhaps which gives her her
desire for the vote.</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">XXIV
<br />
<small>SHIP’S LOGS</small></p>


<p class="no-indent p2">There is a yard by the river-side in
London—opposite Lambeth or somewhere
thereabouts, I think it must be—where
you may come so close in touch
with Romance as will set your fancy
afire and transport you thousands of
miles away upon the far-off seas of the
Orient.</p>

<p>You may talk in disbelieving tones of
wishing-rings, of seven-leagued boots
and magic carpets, counting them as
fairy tales, food only for the minds of
children; but they are after all only the
poetic materialisation of those same
subtle things in life which give wings
to our own imagination, or bring to eyes
tired with reality the gentle sleep of a
day dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly every one must know the
place I write of. It is where they break
up into logs the timber of those ships
which have had their day—the ships
that have ridden fearless and safe
through a thousand storms, that have
set forth so hopefully into the dim horizon
of the unknown and evaded to the
last the grim, grasping fingers of the
hungry sea.</p>

<p>And there you will see their death
masks, those silent figureheads which,
for so many nights and so many days
with untiring, ever-watchful eyes have
faced the mystery of the deep waters
unafraid. There is something pathetic—there
is something majestic, too—about
those expressionless faces. They
seem so wooden and so foolish when
first you look at them; but as your fancy
sets its wings, as your ears become attuned
to the inwardness that can be
found in all things, however material,
you will catch the sound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
dim, faint voices that have a thousand
tales of the sea to tell, a thousand
yarns to spin, a thousand adventures
to relate.</p>

<p>Nothing is silent in this world. There
is only deafness.</p>

<p>It has always appealed to me as the
most noble of human conceptions, that
burial of the Viking lord. The grandeur
of it is its simplicity. There is
a fine spectacular element in it, too,
but never a trace of bombast. The modern
polished oak coffin with its gaudy
brass fittings, the super-ornate hearse,
the prancing black stallions, the butchery
of a thousand graceful flowers—all
this is bombast if you wish. It no more
speaks of death than speaks the fat figure
of Britannia on the top of the highest
circus car of England. Funerals to-day
have lost all the grandeur of simplicity.
But that riding forth in a burning
ship, stretched out with folded
hands upon the deck his feet had paced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
so oft; riding forth towards that far
horizon which his eyes had ever scanned,
there is a generous nobility in that form
of burial. You can imagine no haggling
with an undertaker over the funeral
about this. Here was no cutting
down of the prices, saving a little on
the coffin here, there a little on the
hearse.</p>

<p>No—this was the Viking’s own ship—the
most priceless possession that he
had. Can you not see it plainly, with
sails set, speeding forth upon its last
voyage—the last voyage for both of
them? And then, as the lapping, leaping
flames catch hold upon the bellied
canvas, I can see her settling down in
the swinging cradle of the waves. I can
see the dense column of smoke mingling
with and veiling the tongues of orange
flame, until she becomes like a little
Altar set out upon a vast sea, offering
up its sacrifice of a human soul to the
ever-implacable gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Now every time you burn a ship’s log
you attend a Viking’s burial. In those
flames of green and gold, of orange,
purple and blue, there is to be found,
if you will use but the eyes for it, all
the romance, all the spirit and colour of
that majestic human sacrifice—the
burial of a Viking lord. As you sit
through the long evenings, while the
rain is beating in sudden, whipping
gusts upon the streaming window pane
and the drops fall spitting and hissing
down the chimney into the fire below,
then the burning of a ship’s log is company
enough for any one. With every
spurt of flame as the tar oozes out from
the sodden wood, and the water, still
clinging in the tenacious timber, bubbles
and boils, you can distinguish but
faintly the stirring voice of Romance
telling of thrilling enterprise and of
great adventure. There are few sailors
can spin a yarn so much to your liking.
Never was there a pirate ship so fleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
or so bold; there were never escapes so
miraculous, or battles so stern, as you
can see when in those long-drawn evenings
you sit alone in the unlighted parlour
and watch a ship’s log burning on
the fire.</p>

<p>Pay no heed to them when they tell
you the green flames come from copper,
the blue from lead, the pale purple from
potassium. The chemist’s laboratory
has its own romance, but it shares nothing
in common with the high seas of
imagination upon which you are riding
now. Let the green flames come from
copper! They are the emeralds, the
treasure of the Orient to you. Let the
blue flames come from lead, the pale
purple from potassium! In your eyes
as you sit there in that darkened room,
with the flame-light flickering upon the
ceiling and the shadows creeping near to
listen to it all, they are the blue sash
around the waist, the purple ’kerchief
about the head of the bravest and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
most bloodthirsty pirate that ever
stepped.</p>

<p>At all times a fire is a companion.
Yet set but a ship’s log upon the flames
and I warrant you will lose yourself and
all about you; lose yourself until the
last light flickers, the last red ember
falls, and the good ship that has borne
you so safely over a thousand seas sinks
down into the grey ashes of majestic
burial.</p>
